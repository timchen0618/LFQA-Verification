A closely related problem is the manner in which harm has been defined \u2014 harm is most commonly framed in terms of standards and sensibilities such as religious values or sexual mores. Rarely are there attempts to quantify harm in terms of objectively measurable symptoms (e.g., sleep disorder, anxiety)."

As recently as the late 1800s, for example, when scientists Josiah C. Nott and George R. Gliddon created the 1854 Types of Mankind (then the leading scientific text on race), they compared black people not to other (white) people but to chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans.\n\n\nWhen used in these contexts, monkey and ape are considered extremely derogatory slang."

At a time when Christopher Columbus was enslaving Native Americans and claiming their lands and work for his own, the word became a slur used by white Europeans to describe Native American people. The usage stuck around for hundreds of years, and it\u2019s still a word that many indigenous peoples around the world find offensive."

On the other hand, sometimes there really is nothing going wrong: you\u2019ve hit the weight-loss jackpot and your body is burning stored fat reserves for energy without feelings of hunger.

At a certain point, a starving person stops being hungry and starts feeling \u201cbuzzed\u201d and full of energy. The person is still starving; their body is just trying to help them get up and find more food before they die of malnutrition.\n\n\nIn this case, the solution is simple, but unpleasant: eat anyway.

One idea, based on anecdotal observations, is that intense activities can distract people from their hunger, said Leah Groppo, a clinical dietician at Stanford Health Care in Palo Alto, California.\n\n\n\"If you're really distracted, oftentimes people are able to lose that sense of hunger,\" Groppo told Live Science. \"Then, over time it [the feelings of hunger] will diminish because you're still hyper-focused on something else.\"\n\n\nHowever, if you're surrounded by enough cues to remind you of your hunger \u2014 say, you're reading a novel but you're by the kitchen, and the smell of dinner is wafting through the air \u2014 then you'll likely remember how hungry you are."

As capacitors store electrical charge, connecting them up to conductive plates on the surface of the scanner allows them to be used to track the details of a fingerprint. The stored charge will be changed slightly when a finger\u2019s ridge is placed over the conductive plates. Conversely, an air gap will leave the charge at the capacitor relatively unchanged. An op-amp integrator circuit is used to track these changes, which can then be recorded by an analog-to-digital converter"

Additionally, they are incredibly tough to fool with some sort of prosthetic, as different materials will record slightly different changes in charge at the capacitor. The only real security risks come from either hardware or software hacking.\n\nCreating a large enough array of these capacitors, typically hundreds if not thousands in a single scanner, allows for a highly detailed image of the ridges and valleys of a fingerprint to be created from nothing more than electrical signals. Just like the optical scanner, more capacitors result in a higher resolution scanner"

So this means if they are tucked away in their gear, most likely in the trunk of a squad car. They may not be on the officer's head at that critical moment when it's needed.\n\n\nSo why even try to get every officer outfitted with tactical helmets?\n\n\nBecause law enforcement officers are continually being called upon to respond quickly to threats on their own. In the case of an active shooter, it can be argued that a tactically sound choice for the officer would be to go to the trunk of the squad car to get kitted up (hard plates, rifle, helmet) before rushing in with nothing more than a pistol and soft armor. That ballistic helmet or hard armor might mean the difference between the police officer staying in the fight and eliminating the threat or becoming another casualty themselves.\n\n\n[Image: law enforcement ballistic helmet in trunk of car. ]\n\n\nPhoto courtesy of officer.com\n\n\nChoosing A Ballistic Helmet\n\n\nHelmets come in in numerous variations and capabilities these days and it may be confusing at first on what you or your police department would be best suited for. The three basic options are going to be the following\n\n\n-PASGT Helmet\n\n\n-Below The Ear Cut like our BTE helmet (MICH/ACH/ECH/LWH)\n\n\n-High Cut like our ATE ballistic helmet. (FAST)\n\n\n[Image: Police ballistic helmet options]\n\n\nPASGT and BTE style helmets are going to provide the most ballistic coverage for police officers. They typically go down over the ear or are at mid-ear on the sides. The drawback here is the extra weight, and if the law enforcement officer is using any kind headset it tends to get squished into the ears uncomfortably."

These toxins can cause respiratory problems, allergic reactions and illness. George says aflatoxin, a specific type mycotoxin found in nuts and grains, can even be cancer-causing.\n\n\nMold is usually easy to spot. It often appears as a blue or green discoloration, which can grow a hairy coat if left long enough, Kirkpatrick says. If you\u2019re examining foods in jars\u2014things like pasta sauce or salsa\u2014it\u2019s best to check the underside of the lid and rim of the container for suspicious growths.\n\n\nJust don\u2019t sniff your foods, Kirkpatrick warns, which could lead to you inhaling mold spores. If you\u2019re worried about mold but don\u2019t see any growths, use common sense. \u201cIf the food doesn\u2019t look the way it normally would, and especially if it seems moisture-soaked, toss it,\u201d Kirkpatrick says.\n\n\nThe exceptions: Hard block cheeses like parmesan, cheddar or Swiss. \u201cWith those, the mold generally won\u2019t penetrate deep into the product,\u201d Kirkpatrick says. But don\u2019t start scraping, which can release mold spores into the air or allow them to spread to your countertops or other foods. The only safe way to remove that mold is to cut away an inch of cheese all the way around the spot, she says. \u201cYou\u2019ll probably cut away some safe parts, but that\u2019s a good rule of thumb.\u201d"

The cerebellum performs a variety of functions, like the regulation of timing and motor movement (via UT Health). Because of this, our brains are able to anticipate our next move before we make it. A study conducted by researchers at Queen's University found that self-administered physical stimuli were less perceived by the brain than stimuli administered to participants from an external source (via Science Daily). This occurrence is known as sensory attenuation and results in our brain deactivating our own tickle response.\n\n\nTry as we might, it's not possible to outsmart our own brains. Tickling serves a specific physical purpose when it comes to detecting danger, but it also plays a role in our emotions as well. Studies have found that the same part of our brain is stimulated when we're tickled as when we hear a funny joke. Therefore, tickling can serve multiple purposes \u2014 as long as we don't see it coming."

                "text": "We aren't aware of a lot of the sensations generated by our movements. For example, you probably don't pay much attention to your vocal cords when you speak. For the same reason, we can't tickle ourselves. If we grab our sides in an attempt to tickle ourselves, our brain anticipates this contact from the hands and prepares itself for it. By taking away the feeling of unease and panic, the body no longer responds the same as it would if someone else were to tickle us.\n\n\nBrain scientists at the University College London have pinpointed the cerebellum as the part of the brain that prevents us from self-tickling. The cerebellum is the region located at the base of the brain that monitors our movements. It can distinguish expected sensations from unexpected sensations. An expected sensation would be the amount of pressure your fingers apply to your keyboard while typing. An unexpected sensation would be someone sneaking up behind you and tapping you on the shoulder. While the brain discards the sensation of typing, it pays a lot of attention to someone tapping on your shoulder. The difference in reactions from expected to unexpected is a built-in response that probably developed in early human history to detect predators."

Instead, there are numerous private businesses operating in the sector, including large international corporations. The activities of these companies are regulated on the state and federal level. To begin exploration for oil and gas drilling, the business must obtain a development permit, a drilling permit, and an operating permit. The requirements for gaining these permits are stipulated at the state level. There must also be a public review period, which is often contentious. All permits must be obtained prior to beginning exploration, or the applicant may face delays and financial and legal penalties. In addition to permits, there are various standards and rules that companies must comply with when operating in the oil and gas industry."

The tradeoff in a free but regulated economic system such as that in the United States is to allow the continued extraction of natural resources but to require a commitment to protection of the environment in return. This bargain promotes long-term sustainability by balancing the interests of the environment, state and local governments, and users of natural resources. However, this public-private collaboration is not without controversy.\n\n\nThe Keystone XL Pipeline\n\n\nThe case of the Keystone XL pipeline is an example of the emotional aspect of many environmental disputes, as our nation tries to come to grips with sustainability issues. Local and national opponents of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry crude oil from Canada to the Texas Gulf Coast, have protested for years to stop its construction ((Figure)). These efforts accelerated after President Trump approved the pipeline in March 2017, reversing President Obama\u2019s decision to reject it on environmental grounds. It appears that the pipeline is likely to be completed, pending legal action still unresolved in Nebraska."

Wallace suggested that the bright colors worn by reef fish may actually help them hide in an equally colorful environment. While fish are pink and green and purple and blue, so are the corals, sponges and other parts of the visually complex background behind them. \u201cHe said, well, these colors might actually have a protective function \u2014 they might actually function like camouflage in a sense against these heterogeneous backgrounds,\u201d Rosenthal says."

Even with some reef fish\u2019s intricate color pattern, no two are exactly alike. In his research on cleaner fish in the Indo-Pacific region, Lorenz studied striped cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus). While he couldn\u2019t tag the little fish, he could photograph them and tell the difference between individuals by their markings in photographs. \u201cIf we can, you can bet they can,\u201d he says.\n\n\nBy having \u201ciconically different\u201d color patterns, Rosenthal says, fish are able to minimize the costs of aggression \u2014 in other words, if you\u2019re different from everyone you\u2019re not competing with, you\u2019re not going to have a lot of inter-species conflict that would sap your energy."

When the air is very dry, that moisture evaporates, which means that the virus particle can stay aloft in the air longer and makes it more likely that it will be inhaled by a passerby.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIn the summertime, that little sphere of moisture doesn\u2019t evaporate very quickly because it is humid outside, so gravity pulls it down to the earth,\u201d he continues. And once it\u2019s on the ground, it\u2019s outside the breathing zone and can\u2019t get inside you to infect you as easily.\n\n\nWater vapor in humid air also appears to harm viruses by deforming their surface, thereby affecting their ability to attack our cells and infect our bodies."

Manufacturers of reading glasses often contribute to consumer confusion by referring to magnification power and diopter strength interchangeably. They are not the same thing. But it\u2019s easier for people to understand magnification than the science of lenses.\n\nA slightly more technical explanation. With every power option, or \u201cdiopter\u201d, there is a sweet spot range where close vision is brought into sharp focus. This changes from person to person. If the diopter is too weak for your individual needs, you will need to move the material farther away from your face to see it clearly. If the diopter is too strong, that range of sweet spot will be closer than you prefer. The average person reads material between 14 - 18 inches away from their face. If you would like to restore a comfortable reading range that is within that, find a diopter that sharpens focus in this range. In contrast, if you are working at your desk and your computer monitor is 24 inches away, you will need a weaker power than you would for reading."

The people who gave them their name: those who actually drove teams of horses to pull wagons around in the pre-Industrial Revolution days. As best as our research could dig up, many wagons lacked a place to sit, so the teamster who was driving the horses would sit in the next-best place to see both road and steeds: atop one of the horses pulling up the rear. As most people are right-handed, most teamsters would need the whip in their right hand \u2014 so it made more sense to sit on the left-hand horse.\n\n\nAnd with most drivers sitting on the left-hand side of their rides, it made sense to arrange traffic so that vehicles would ride on the right-hand side of the road. This, as we all know from driving today, enables the drivers to sit closer to the center line \u2014 and thus closer to oncoming traffic, so they could better gauge how close they were passing to those onrushing vehicles."

This limits the risk of electrical shock, a concern in the bathroom where lots of water can be present. In addition, the current is very low. It will power a shaver or electric toothbrush, but not an item like a heater or a hair dryer. The circuit will shut down if it gets too hot, thus keeping the user as safe as possible.\n\n\nOften a bathroom shaver socket is mounted up high and may be behind a hidden panel. There may be a small plaque indicating that it should only be used with bathroom shavers."

If you touch the live wire of a normal electrical supply you get the full mains voltage (230V relative to earth) across you and if you touch the neutral wire you only have a few volts (about zero relative to earth). With an isolating transformer, the wires are 'floating'. There is still the full mains voltage between them but they are both 'isolated' from earth. Whichever one you touch, only a tiny current will flow through you and its voltage, relative to earth, will be nearly zero - you will get no shock. The other wire will be at full mains voltage but, as you aren't touching it, you don't get a shock."

Milk film can be produced both through conventional boiling and by microwaving the liquid, and as such can often be observed when heating milk for use in drinks such as drinking chocolate. It is caused by the denaturation of proteins such as beta-lactoglobulin (whey protein). The thickness of the skin varies dependent on a number of factors, including the temperature of the milk, the shape of the container, and the amount of milk in the container.\n\n\nWhen milk is boiled, soluble milk proteins are denatured and then coagulate with milk's fat and form a sticky film across the top of the liquid, which then dries by evaporation. The layer does not need to be discarded and can be consumed, as protein's nutritional value is unaffected by the denaturation process.

So people who recall dreams may have a difference in their ability to memorize things in general.\n\n\nBeyond that, a person\u2019s brain may actually block out a dream so we don\u2019t remember it the following day. \u201cThe dream activity can be so real and intense that our brains actually hide, or mask away the dream, so [it doesn\u2019t] get lost between our waking experience, and our dream lives. Thus it is normal to forget dreams, most of the time.\u201d Dimitriu says."

Overall, such people are prone to daydreaming, creative thinking, and introspection. At the same time, those who are more practical and focused on what is outside themselves tend to have difficulty remembering their dreams.\u201d\n\n\nThis may mean that some people are naturally more likely to recall their dreams than others, despite their quality of sleep.\n\n\nOther factors, like stress or experiencing a trauma, can also cause people to have vivid dreams or nightmares that they\u2019re more likely to recall the next day. For example, a person who\u2019s coping with grief after losing a loved one may dream about the death in elaborate detail. Remembering the dream the next day may affect mood and cause even more stress or anxiety."

                "text": "People who have the ability to recall their dreams five mornings per week, on average, have more spontaneous activity occurring in certain parts of their brains than others. The parts of the brain that host these increased levels of activity are called the temporo-parietal junction, which is an information-processing hub, and the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for the expression of personality as well as the planning of complex cognitive behaviors. And, interestingly, this escalation in liveliness is higher during both wakefulness and sleep, so says a study of 41 people recently published online February 19 in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology. The activity in the brains of the people in this study were measured by Positron Emission Tomography while they were awake and sleeping. What do these findings tell us?\n\n\nIn combination with previous research from one of the study\u2019s authors, Perrine Ruby, the findings tell us why some people remember their dreams and some do not. Ruby co-authored related research that was published last year in the journal Cerebral Cortex, which showed that people who have the ability to regularly recall their dreams are also more reactive to sounds when they are both asleep and awake. Ruby made some comments in a recent statement that synthesized the findings for both of these studies. Ruby stated that the brain needs to awaken from sleep in order to memorize new information. This, said Ruby, may explain the reason that those who react more to environmental stimuli can remember their dreams better; they simply are awakened more often and can therefore better encode into memory their dreams than others who are less reactive to sounds. In addition, the researchers said that people who often recall their dreams may also have more dreams than \u201clow-recall\u201d dreamers."

Microsoft developers wanted to make changes to certain devices without going through the hassle of getting authorized keys to Secure Boot. So they developed a secret \u201csuper policy\u201d for bypassing Secure Boot completely. Had this Golden Key \u201csuper policy\u201d been discovered by hackers it would have given them unlimited access to nearly every computer in the world. The only good news to this story is that this backdoor nuclear weapon was discovered by \u201cGood Guy\u201d researchers before it was discovered by Bad Guy hackers. https://www.infoworld.com/article/3106079/security/secure-boot-proves-insecurity-of-backdoors.html\n\n\nAfter the researchers notified Microsoft of the issue, the company released a security patch MS16-094 in July 2016. This \u201cgolden key\u201d super policy is now blocked from loading on computers with the July patch installed. However, the July patch is not a complete fix -- it's at most a small roadblock. The issue remains only partially addressed, and what's worse, it is believed that it is impossible for Microsoft to fully revoke the leaked Golden Key Super policy.\n\n\n[Image: 1.4.09]\n\n\nBecause of the implications of this Golden Key Backdoor being released to the wild, the two researchers wrote a letter to the FBI explaining why the entire concept of having super keys to all computers was a bad idea:\n\n\n\u201cMicrosoft implemented a 'secure golden key' system. And the golden keys got released by Microsoft's own stupidity. Now, what happens if you tell everyone to make a 'secure golden key' system? This is a perfect real-world example about why your idea of backdooring cryptosystems with a 'golden key' is very bad!\u201d\n\n\nThe first lesson we should learn from the 2016 Golden Key incident is that keys and secrets will eventually get leaked or stolen. The second lesson is that a fix is not always possible."

It's part of Microsoft's Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) and ensures each component loaded during the boot process is validated.\n\n\nThe all-access keys were discovered by MY123 and Slipstream in March 2016. A recent blog post (animated site with tinny, arcade-style music) by researchers at MY123 and Slipstream dives into the details of Microsoft's security problems and the errors it made in addressing them.\n\n\n[Google: QuadRooter threat is blocked on most Android devices.]\n\n\nNote that the golden key isn't an actual key, but a means of changing the tasks launched by UEFI during the boot process, as explained in a report by Ars Technica. The policy has been made available online. It will enable anyone to disable the Secure Boot feature.\n\n\nSecure Boot can be disabled on several types of desktop PCs, but is hard-coded into most devices running Windows. It seems the golden key is intended to turn off OS checks so programmers can test new projects. However, it can also leave Windows devices vulnerable.\n\n\nThe keys leaked by Microsoft will allow users with admin rights to install any operating system -- like Linux or Android -- on their Windows PCs, smartphones, or tablets."

But there\u2019s really nothing \u201celaborate\u201d about it; it\u2019s actually pretty simple. \u201cIt\u2019s a type of psychological pricing,\u201d says Julie Ramhold, consumer analyst with DealNews.com. \u201cBecause we read from left to right, we pay less attention to the end of the number versus the beginning.\u201d This is especially effective if you\u2019re just quickly perusing several prices in a row; the first number will definitely stand out to you more. Psychological pricing is powerful, but luckily, there are also plenty of psychology tricks to help you spend less while shopping.\n\nOf course, we still know that $9.99 is basically ten dollars, not nine dollars. But the $.99 trick takes advantage of the way our brains process prices. When we see a price of $9.99, we associate it as part of the $9\u2013$9.99 \u201crange\u201d rather than the $10\u2013$10.99 \u201crange.\u201d \u201cConsumers don\u2019t want to transcend a certain category, so even a penny less may make a huge psychological difference,\u201d explains Subimal Chatterjee, Distinguished Teaching Professor of Marketing at Binghamton University School of Management."

Recognizing that this could affect the number of calories actually available from almonds, researchers at USDA's Agricultural Research Service decided to specifically determine the calories absorbed. We were not at all surprised to learn from Dr. Baer\u2019s work that fewer calories from almonds are available for absorption. However, we were pleasantly surprised by the magnitude of the difference. In 2011, Dr. Baer conducted research using the same methodology to find out available calories from pistachios and found that the number was only 5% lower than previously thought, while the number for almonds was 20% lower."

Mechanical processes, such as roasting, chopping and grinding play a role because they disrupt the cell wall of almonds and affect particle size. Particle size is also affected when almonds are chewed and digested in the body. The larger the particle size, the less the almond is broken down by digestive enzymes and the more of the almond is excreted, so fewer calories are absorbed. The reverse is also true: the smaller the particle size, the more calories are absorbed. Further research is needed to better understand the results of this study and how this method of measuring calories could potentially affect the calorie count of other foods."

Depending on the size of the asteroid, this could last for as much as two years."

Some of this dust was too close to the planet to form stable moons, and instead formed rings.

Any dust and ice not incorporated into the planet itself would have coalesced into the regular moons we see today around the giant planets. These satellites are in nearly circular orbits near the equators of their host planets, such as the four Galilean satellites around Jupiter and Titan around Saturn, which are all composed of large fractions of ice.\n\n\nBecause the giant planets gravitationally dominate a very large area, they also can efficiently capture passing objects as moons, which we call irregular satellites. These irregular moons are relatively small and have orbits with large inclinations, eccentricities, and semimajor axes.\n\n\nIn contrast, the terrestrial planets formed much closer to the Sun with much less material around them. They grew slowly by accreting many small rocky planetesimals and never grew massive enough to capture a disk of gas and dust. Earth\u2019s Moon probably formed through a direct collision.

So over time, through collisions and crashes, the cloud loses its loft and flattens into a spinning, roughly two dimensional, disk shape, like a solar system or spiral galaxy."

However, it is not possible for laser show producers to be responsible for all cameras, smartphones and camcorders which might be used at a show.\n\n\nTips for audience members with cameras when lasers are in use\n\n\n\n\nIf you attend a laser show as an audience member, you should take reasonable precautions not to let a laser beam DIRECTLY enter your camera lens.\n\n\n* You can photograph the beams in midair, or doing graphics on a screen. If you can't see the laser source (projector output aperture or bounce mirror) in your viewfinder, this means you're not getting the full beam power into your lens. Indirect viewing like this should not cause damage.\n\n\n\n\n* Avoid beams which are coming straight into your lens (or bounced off a mirror or other reflective surface and then into your lens). The damage potential is much greater when the entire beam power enters the camera lens.\n\n\nDegree of camera damage\n\n\n\n\nThe degree of damage can vary widely.\n\n\n* We have seen cases of minor damage, such as small areas of a few pixels which no longer work. The pixels are not noticeable unless in an area of uniform color such as a blue sky.\n\n\n\n\n* In more extreme cases, there may be larger or more extensive dead-pixel areas. Or there may be \"burn in\" of a laser image. The damage is readily noticeable in most photos or videos. In this case, the camera is ruined for quality use. The image below shows numerous laser-"

They could lower the cap on non-audit fees charged to an audit client from today\u2019s generous level of 70% of the audit fee. Under rules introduced in 2016, British companies with the same auditor for ten years must re-tender; they are forced to rotate after 20. Such rules look draconian to American eyes, where the average auditor tenure for the first 21 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average to have made disclosures this year is a cosy 66 years. New research finds that auditors are most likely to find misstatements early in their tenure; by the tenth year, the benefits of a fresh pair of eyes are lost. Academics also find that the Big Four\u2019s fees rise with tenure. Even Britain\u2019s 20-year limit is too long.\n\n\nAuditors in many countries are already required to add flesh to the bare bones of the audit opinion. That is to be encouraged. Transparency over the main points of contention with management, and the size of revisions made to the accounts as a result of scrutiny, would cast light on auditors\u2019 successes, not just their failures. And that in turn would help investors to assess auditors\u2019 performance."

The question of how it manages to do so in the absence of a medium is explained by the nature of electromagnetic vibrations. When a charged particle vibrates, it produces an electrical vibration that automatically induces a magnetic one -- physicists often visualize these vibrations occurring in perpendicular planes. The paired oscillations propagate outward from the source; no medium, except for the electromagnetic field that permeates the universe, is required to conduct them."

Similar to wiggling the end of the rope, we can change the electric or magnetic field at one point, and that disturbance travels away from us. (One way to change the magnetic field at a point is to hold a magnet there, then wiggle it back and forth.) Unlike the wave in the rope, these waves actually travel away from us in all directions. It turns out that in a vacuum, for example in outer space, these waves travel at exactly the speed of light! It doesn't matter how rapidly the fields wiggle back and forth, they will always travel at the same speed. (In air, the waves go ever so slightly slower than in vacuum, and in glass, they can go only about two-thirds as fast as they would in vacuum, but this is not important right now. From now on, when I talk about the speed of light, I mean the speed of light in a vacuum, and I'm talking about waves traveling in a vacuum.) The conclusion that physicists have drawn from this result is that light consists of waves of electric and magnetic fields. This is a fascinating result: that we learn something about light by studying magnets and electrical currents."

In empty space, the wave does not dissipate (grow smaller) no matter how far it travels, because the wave is not interacting with anything else. This is why light from distant stars can travel through space for billions of light-years and still reach us on earth. However, light can also travel within some materials, like glass and water. In this case, some light is absorbed and lost as heat, just like sound. So, underwater, or in our atmosphere, light will only travel some finite range (which is different depending on the properties of the material it travels through)."

Now, with the use of the word \u201cLatino,\u201d with a capital, this bureaucratic category has been enlarged to include people of non-Spanish descent if they so wish to be categorized.

This is the case, for example, of some residents of Mexican descent in the United States, who do not want to be called \u201cHispanics,\u201d but \u201cLatinos.\u201d One reason given is to have their own collective identity separate from that of other collective identities somehow associated with Spain and its heritage.

Similarly, specialized cells in the nose pick up odorants, airborne odor molecules. Odorants stimulate receptor proteins found on hairlike cilia at the tips of the sensory cells, a process that initiates a neural response. Ultimately, messages about taste and smell converge, allowing us to detect the flavors of food."

This chemoreception in regards to taste, occurs via the presence of specialized taste receptors within the mouth that are referred to as taste cells and are bundled together to form taste buds. These taste buds, located in papillae which are found across the tongue, are specific for the five modalities: salt, sweet, sour, bitter and umami. These receptors are activated when their specific stimulus (i.e. sweet or salt molecules) is present and signals to the brain."

With formication, you might also describe the \u201ccrawling\u201d sensation as feeling like \u201cpins and needles.\u201d Formication is also called a tactile hallucination. This means that you\u2019re feeling a sensation that has no physical cause.\n\n\nFormication can be a symptom of several conditions. These conditions include fibromyalgia and Parkinson\u2019s disease. Withdrawal from alcohol or drug use can also trigger formication."

As the oil and gas are released, those injection fluids and briny water also come up. That wastewater is later disposed of in what are called injection wells, or sometimes disposal wells.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that it is not the fracking process itself that usually causes these earthquakes; it is the rapid injection of fluid during wastewater disposal that sometimes pumps hundreds of millions of gallons of brine deep into the earth each year."

A poor defendant who can't afford bail may spend days, even weeks, in jail waiting to see a judge for a crime where prison time might not even be required. At that point, it's hard to justify spending time or money fighting the charge, even if backing down leaves an innocent person with a criminal record.\n\n\"Everybody who works in the system knows that the assembly-line cash bail system coerces guilty pleas,\" says Civil Rights Corps founder and executive director Alec Karakatsanis. Because American courts don't have the manpower to prosecute and try every person who gets arrested, he argues, \"the system needs a way to coerce them into pleading guilty.

Furthermore, it's much easier to damage the tiny pins on a VGA/DVI connector, whereas I'm sure most people would agree it's much harder to bend/twist a power connector (save for stepping on the thing).\n\n\nIndeed, this is also the reason why many of these connectors still 'screw' into things. Of course it's not a huge deal if the cable falls out of the computer, which is also why you don't have to use the screws if you don't want to. However, it's usually safer to use them to prevent accidental disconnection (saves you the headache of checking behind your computer every time your monitor blanks out), and indeed, a typical VGA/DVI connector lacks the physical holding pressure a standard USB connector does."

In the nineteenth century, most newspapers were explicitly linked to a particular political party and the economic interests of the publisher."

Subtle things like word choice, time limits on programming, and sponsors may all suggest that the organization isn't neutral. Each individual who reports or writes the news also has to work hard to guard against revealing his or her own opinions. These opinions can reveal bias simply through word choice or inflections and tone of voice when delivering news.\n\n\n[Image: The media is often described as biased.] The media is often described as biased.\n\n\nOne form of media bias is the failure to include varied points of view on a story. Often, this may be viewed as failing to include the opposite viewpoint, but it would be virtually impossible to include all viewpoints on a particular issue, since people approach issues from more than two directions. For example, those belonging to fringe political parties like the Libertarians or Green Party, often feel their viewpoint is not adequately represented in journalism.\n\n\n[Image: One form of media bias is the failure to include varied points of view on a story.] One form of media bias is the failure to include varied points of view on a story.\n\n\nThis failure to represent all sides of the story may not be intentional bias, however.

The media can still technically be biased since it cannot represent all points of view."

You\u2019re hoping for the car of course.\n* Monty Hall, the game show host, examines the other doors (B & C) and opens one with a goat. (If both doors have goats, he picks randomly.)\n\n\nHere\u2019s the game: Do you stick with door A (original guess) or switch to the unopened door? Does it matter?\n\n\nSurprisingly, the odds aren\u2019t 50-50. If you switch doors you\u2019ll win 2/3 of the time!\n\n\nToday let\u2019s get an intuition for why a simple game could be so baffling. The game is really about re-evaluating your decisions as new information emerges.\n\n\n## Play the game\n\n\nYou\u2019re probably muttering that two doors mean it\u2019s a 50-50 chance. Ok bub, let\u2019s play the game:\n\n\nTry playing the game 50 times, using a \u201cpick and hold\u201d strategy. Just pick door 1 (or 2, or 3) and keep clicking. Click click click. Look at your percent win rate. You\u2019ll see it settle around 1/3.\n\n\nNow reset and play it 20 times, using a \u201cpick and switch\u201d approach. Pick a door, Monty reveals a goat (grey door), and you switch to the other. Look at your win rate. Is it above 50% Is it closer to 60%? To 66%?\n\n\nThere\u2019s a chance the stay-and-hold strategy does decent on a small number of trials (under 20 or so). If you had a coin, how many flips would you need to convince yourself it was fair? You might get 2 heads in a row and think it was rigged. Just play the game a few dozen times to even it out and reduce the noise.\n\n\n## Understanding Why Switching Works\n\n\nThat\u2019s the hard (but convincing) way of realizing switching works. Here\u2019s an easier way:\n\n\nIf I pick a door and hold, I have a 1/3 chance of winning."

To get a job somewhere you have to sound literally like you're from nowhere,\" Caples told Life's Little Mysteries. \"They're not going to hire you in Yuma, Arizona, if you talk like you're from the Bronx.\"\n\n\nAnother reason why news anchors share speech patterns is that they are all taught to use standard broadcasting English, a form of pronunciation in which no letters are dropped. For example, they must always say \"fishing,\" not \"fishin'.\" They also speak more slowly than people do in daily life in order to be easily understandable, Caples said.\n\n\nThere's the added fact that most broadcasters are emulating the voices of their role models, and so speech patterns get passed down. \"I think there's a lot of patterning,\" she said. \"If you've grown up listening to a certain anchor, or admire someone on TV, then there's a subconscious effort to mirror that. A lot of women want to sound like Oprah, for example; she has a great voice.\""

A Southerner trying to remove any trace of a drawl is going to sound different than someone from New England attempting to do the same. We may not notice simply because humans aren\u2019t that great at recognizing more subtle accents, especially our own. Broadcasters may sound alike in large part because they all enunciate and attempt to achieve articulatory precision. Few anchors will say \u201cdubya.\u201d They will say \u201cdouble-you.\u201d But that occasional \u201cdubya\u201d is what makes speech patterns sound different."

It's a completely involuntary reaction, which explains why your dog may look as puzzled as you do when it starts to happen. When you scratch or tickle your dog's belly, it irritates him, much the same way that the wind or a bug might. It activates nerves under his skin that are connected to his spinal cord and relays a message to his leg muscles to kick in an attempt to get rid of the irritant."

Gleeking is more likely when the salivary gland has been recently stimulated, but even a residual amount of saliva in the gland may be released by gleeking.

Finally, on 18 March, the first free elections were held in East Germany, and a government led by Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re (CDU) was formed under a policy of expeditious unification with West Germany.

As the ripening period increases, the cheese loses more moisture, develops a stronger flavour and becomes harder and more crumbly in texture"

They believed in more wholesome living and doing what they could with what Earth has to offer.\n\nMuch of the hippie movement came about as a result of the Vietnam War. The people of the U.S. were constantly paranoid and developed a sort of greed that came along with the anger of this war. Tensions among Americans built, and these white, middle-class youngsters lead the way to change it. The hippie movement was all about finding oneself and rejecting the need to conform to what society expects of us all. It was also about fighting peacefully against war and violence. Hippies believed that the government was the root of all the country\u2019s problems as well as greed and hatred that ran rampant in the streets. The goal was to get the country to see that war is not the answer to its problems, but rather peace, love, and freedom"

Each empirical method uses a different way of measuring variation in the quantity of immigrants to generate wage estimates. Dustmann, Schonberg, and Stuhler (2016) summarize the three major methods as (1) the national skill-cell approach, (2) the pure spatial approach, and (3) a mixed approach. The national skill-cell approach uses variation in the entry of immigrants to different education-experience groups within the national population. The pure spatial approach uses variation in the immigrant flow across cities or regions. The mixed approach uses variation in immigration inflows across both education groups and regions."

Fast-forward another 70,000 years and early man has recognized the value of sharpened flint, not only good for striking fire, but also for delicately slicing off hair from the body!\n\n[Image: not only do i keep my face smooth but i also built this computer meme]\n\nThe real history of shaving, however, doesn\u2019t begin until we reach the Egyptian civilization, where the act of shaving made its real debut on the world stage. Egyptians had a powerful belief that body hair was a sign of uncleanliness, so both men and women engaged in the complete removal of hair from the body\u2014head to toe! In some cases, caustic ingredients like quicklime and arsenic were used in these primitive depilatory creams and shaving lotions. Early razors also appeared around the time, with the rise in metalworking and mining in many areas of the world. The Egyptian relationship to cleanliness and body hair bordered on the obsessive, and the upper classes often bathed multiple times per day. They would shave their heads completely bald, and then design cooling wigs to wear out in public.\n\nThe fear of uncleanliness was a real concern, and may have been the early reason for prehistoric man to shave as well. Body hair provides an ideal environment for lice and other unwanted critters, and can also be a breeding ground for fungal infections, particularly in hot or humid weather. Egyptians attempted to eliminate the risk of pests or pathogens by removing any environment where they could thrive! Furthermore, in the hot and humid weather of Egypt, having an excess of body hair led to the much faster development of body odor, another sign of uncleanliness within the rigid Egyptian society."

But critics point out it doesn't come without its economic and environmental costs.\n\n## Costs and Environmental Impact of Desalination\n\nAccording to the non-profit Food & Water Watch, desalinated ocean water is the most expensive form of fresh water out there, given the infrastructure costs of collecting, distilling and distributing it. The group reports that, in the U.S., desalinated water costs at least five times as much to harvest as other sources of fresh water. Similar high costs are a big hurdle to desalination efforts in poor countries as well, where limited funds are already stretched too thin.\n\nOn the environmental front, widespread desalination could take a heavy toll on ocean biodiversity. \"Ocean water is filled with living creatures, and most of them are lost in the process of desalination,\" says Sylvia Earle, one of the world's foremost marine biologists and a National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence. \u201cMost are microbial, but intake pipes to desalination plants also take up the larvae of a cross-section of life in the sea, as well as some fairly large organisms\u2026part of the hidden cost of doing business,\u201d she says."

Eager to please potential customers, photographers immediately resorted to manual intervention, enlivening their pictures with powdered pigment, watercolor and oil paint.\n\n\nEarly photography was color-blind in other ways as well. In the 19th century, photographic emulsions were much more sensitive to blue and violet light than to other colors on the spectrum, which meant that blue skies almost always appeared blotchy and overexposed. To overcome the problem, many landscape photographers would make two separate negatives \u2014 one exposed for the land, the other for the sky \u2014 and print them together on a single sheet of paper. The French photographer Gustave Le Gray used this technique in his majestic seascapes of the 1850s. The exhibition features three seascapes by Le Gray, all using the same cloud negative. The show also includes a great pair of before-and-after landscapes by the American photographer Carleton Watkins \u2014 one with a blank white sky, the other with added clouds."

                "text": "There are actually a number of valid reasons it\u2019s good to increase visibility inside of a stall. If the door went all the way to the floor, other occupants might not be able to notice if someone in a stall was having a problem and lost consciousness. The gap provides visibility in case a person inside is in some kind of distress. It also helps first responders, who could pull the occupant out without having to break down the door.\n\n\nA gap also provides just enough of a dent in privacy to make any kind of undesirable public behavior\u2014like sexual activity or drug use\u2014less practical.\n\n\nThere are economical and logistical considerations, too. Doors that come only part of the way down are universal, meaning that suppliers and installers don\u2019t need to custom-measure them. This saves on costs. Small doors also make cleaning floors in and around the stalls easier. This was the motivation behind the partitions famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright designed for the influential Larkin Building that stood in Buffalo, New York, from 1903 to 1950. Many of his ideas, like small bathroom doors, became a standard of business construction.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re still not convinced gaps are a design win, consider that an enclosed stall is going to have only limited air circulation. The last thing you want or need in a public bathroom is to trap odors. It also helps keep loitering to a minimum. (Then again, so would the stench.)"

                "text": "Easier to Clean: By having a gap at the bottom, bathroom partitions are much easier to clean, as is the whole restroom. You can hose down or even powerwash a restroom that has partitions with gaps at the bottom because the water has somewhere to run even if there\u2019s not a drain in a given stall.\n* Emergency Access: If someone loses consciousness in a fully enclosed bathroom, it may take hours for someone to notice. If this happens in a stall with a gap at the bottom, the odds are good someone will notice much quicker, which is important in instances where every second can mean the difference between life and death. Instead of having to break down the door, a first responder can crawl through the gap at the bottom of the partition and unlock the door to render help.\n* Deterrent to Undesirable Behavior: Because people can partially see into a bathroom stall that has a gap at the bottom, this type of partition is a natural deterrent to undesirable behavior, such as someone spray painting the stall with graffiti.\n* More Affordable: Partitions that don\u2019t extend from the floor to the ceiling don\u2019t have to be custom made to fit a room\u2019s exact measurements and they don\u2019t require as many materials to construct. This makes them considerably more affordable.\n* Better Air Circulation: Better air circulation is one of the top reasons why there are gaps under toilet stalls. While restrooms with this kind of partition may still get a bit stinky from time to time, things would be even more overwhelming in a fully enclosed stall.\n* Keeps the Line Moving: Having a gap at the base of a partition allows people waiting in line to see if a stall is occupied or vacant. This visibility keeps the line moving and prevents wait times from being any longer than they have to be. When a stall isn\u2019t fully enclosed, people often feel like they have to take care of their business even faster, which also helps keep the line moving.\n* ADA Compliance: Space is needed to allow for easier maneuverability for patrons in a wheelchair. The gap allows toe space for wheelchair"

However, it\u2019s so easy for sleepiness to be ruined by a sudden high-pitched police alarm or the cheers of drunken revelers. The reason this is such an issue is that, unlike a constant noise, or brains just can\u2019t get used to sudden volume spikes. Every sudden noise could be a danger, which leaves us permanently on alert and unable to relax. After all, sleep is when we\u2019re most defenseless, so our brain really doesn\u2019t want to \u2018switch off\u2019 when there\u2019s what seems like potential danger."

If you\u2019re lying in almost complete silence, maybe with a little wind outside, that\u2019s around 20 decibels. That sudden 50 decibel jump is HUGE, and will totally spring you awake. Instead, if you have a white noise generator or are playing white noise from your speakers/laptop, this could be a nice, continuous sound at around 50 decibels (just about the level of normal conversation). Suddenly, that same 70 decibel car noise is only a 20 decibel jump. It\u2019s much less noticeable, and so much less likely to shock you into being jolted awake."

A long strategy is the traditional way of making money on the stock markets; buying low and selling high. A short strategy is the reverse, selling high and buying low.\n\n\nThe Dukes believe because of the fake crop report that there will be a shortage of orange juice, and the price will therefore skyrocket. So, by buying all the juice available now, when the shortage is revealed, everyone will have to buy it off of them at inflated prices. Louis and Billy Ray, on the other hand, know that there is plenty of juice available, and begin selling contracts at the high price the Dukes have created. Importantly, they are promising to deliver orange juice that they don\u2019t actually own yet, but are planning to buy up the juice they need to deliver after the crop report is released.\n\n\nOnce the official report is made public, all the other traders are desperate to sell, in order to minimise their losses. In fact, they have already made a loss, but if they can sell the juice that they have bought, then they might be able to make back a little of their money. Because the other traders are frantically selling, Louis and Billy Ray can buy very cheaply all the orange juice they need in order to fulfil the contracts they have already made. If they weren\u2019t able to buy the juice they needed, they would default on their promised deliveries, leaving them owing potentially millions of dollars. Short selling can be a profitable strategy, but it is also a risky one."

And of course: rigged insider information. This is the most important piece of the puzzle. Short-selling can only be fully efficient if you know the price will go down. Then you can scam everyone else easily.\n\n\nThe insider information I'm referring to is the Dept of Agriculture crop report for oranges (they're trading a commodity - frozen orange juice). The Dukes hired their secret agent Mr Beeks to get them the report before anyone else sees it. Unfortunately for them, Winthorpe and Valentine get their hands on the report before the Dukes do and feed them false information. The Dukes are led to believe that the weather was bad and so the harvest was less than normal. Therefore the Dukes are expecting high prices (low supply + high demand = high prices). However the actual report signals the opposite - the harvest was unaffected by the bad weather, and the supply will be plentiful. Hence the scope for short-selling, as Winthorpe and Valentine know that the price is likely to go down."

For a digital audio recording, this can be accomplished through sample rate conversion. Unfortunately, the frequencies in the recording are always scaled at the same ratio as the speed, transposing its perceived pitch up or down in the process. Slowing down the recording to increase duration also lowers the pitch, speeding it up for a shorter duration also raises the pitch creating the Chipmunk effect. Thus the two effects cannot be separated when using this method. A drum track containing no pitched instruments can be moderately sample-rate converted to adjust tempo without adverse effects, but a pitched track cannot."

Puppies will also naturally engage in this behavior, eating both their own poop (autocoprophagia), poop from other dogs (allocoprophagia), as well as poop from cats and other animals. Some dogs find horse manure and goose droppings particularly appealing. Eating their own poop is harmless, but consuming poop from other animals may cause health problems if the stool is contaminated with parasites, viruses, or toxins.

When the planets in our solar system began to form, space was filled with billions and billions of pieces of dust and gas.\n\n\nAs these pieces bumped into each other, they began to form clumps that slowly grew larger and larger. Eventually these clumps of material grew large enough to develop their own gravitational fields.\n\n\nAs the forming planets continued to grow, the force of the collisions with additional matter caused them to become hot and molten, acting much like a liquid. Each planet's gravitational force is centered at its core. It pulls equally in every direction from the core, thus pulling all the molten material into a spherical shape. Scientists call this process \"isostatic adjustment.\""

With its large body and internal heating from radioactive elements, a planet behaves like a fluid, and over long periods of time succumbs to the gravitational pull from its center of gravity. The only way to get all the mass as close to planet's center of gravity as possible is to form a sphere. The technical name for this process is \"isostatic adjustment.\"\n\n\nWith much smaller bodies, such as the 20-kilometer asteroids we have seen in recent spacecraft images, the gravitational pull is too weak to overcome the asteroid's mechanical strength. As a result, these bodies do not form spheres. Rather they maintain irregular, fragmentary shapes."

It's all thanks to a special type of cell in their gums, called stem cells.\n\n\nStem cells are handy because they can morph into different cells when needed. Like tooth stem cells to build new teeth. Humans have these stem cells when we're younger. But after our adult teeth grow in, the stem cells die and disappear."

As a result, mammals evolved different shaped teeth for different purposes. And it's this difference, that could also explain why most mammals can't regrow more teeth.\n\n\nNow, let's say you could regrow your molars multiple times, for example. It's important that the top and bottoms sets match up. Otherwise, they can't grind up food as efficiently. It sounds good in principle, but with each new set, there's a risk that the regrown teeth won't line up. So the leading theory is that adult humans can't regrow our teeth because it was better for survival to only grow one, well-aligned adult set."

It\u2019s a decade when women are sent back into the home.\u201d\n\n\nWith the women\u2019s liberation movement and Title IX, sports reemerged in the 1970s for women, but baseball did not. \u201cBaseball never turned a corner and opened the doors to women,\u201d said Ring.\n\n\nIndeed, there\u2019s evidence there was a concerted effort to keep girls out of baseball. In 1972, the national Little League organization threatened to revoke the charter of a team in Hoboken, New Jersey, because they allowed 12-year-old Maria Pepe to play. The National Organization for Women took on the case and successfully sued to allow for Pepe and other girls to be able to try out. In response to the pressure, Little League created Little League Softball."

Instead, the law dictated that the school must provide an equivalent sport, and in that case, it was softball. Thus, schools were within their right to deny girls who were interested in baseball as long as a softball team was provided.\n\n\nSince then, women all over the country, and now the world, have fought for the chance to play on their school\u2019s baseball team. Some have succeeded, and most have failed, but none have made a serious impact."

Often these traps are found near the periphery or edge of natural water sources. Often the sand on top may appear solid, but with the added pressure of a footstep, the sand will mix with the water beneath it forming a thick sludge."

                "text": "Finally, scientists had found a way to control the weather -- at least in the lab. For the next 30 years, researchers and entrepreneurs across the world began applying the principles developed by Langmuir, Schaefer and Vonnegut to real-world cloud seeding. They flew airplanes into the clouds, releasing their own clouds of silver iodide as they went, or fired artillery shells filled with silver iodide into clouds. In some cases, these weather modifiers were trying to produce rain in drought-afflicted areas, mitigate hail damage by preventing hailstones from growing so large, or disperse fog banks around airports. Many proprietors of this new technology made audacious claims about their cloud seeding services. Unfortunately, hard science could never substantiate the claims. If anything, rigorous experimentation seemed to suggest that cloud seeding barely worked or, worse, didn't work at all.\n\nStill, enough tantalizing evidence has accumulated over the years to keep interest in weather modification alive. For example, research conducted in South Africa and Mexico has shown that seeding warm rain clouds with salt particles -- what is known as hygroscopic seeding -- is more effective than seeding cold rain clouds with silver iodide. And Chinese scientists believe they have mastered cloud seeding to such a degree that they can guarantee a certain day will be rainy or sunny, like say the opening ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, as this related article describes."

Because this water is now less dense than the surrounding water, it will stay on the top and continue to cool.\n\n\nOnce the surface water falls to 32 F, it freezes.

Let\u2019s discuss some of the major key differences:\n\n 1. Usually, SSH uses Port 22, whereas SSL uses Port 443. 2. SSH uses a username/password authentication process to establish a secure connection, whereas SSL does not consider it. 3. SSH is based on network tunnelling, whereas SSL is based on certificates. 4. SSL is used for securely transmitting critical information like credit cards and banking. Whereas SSH is used for securely executing commands across the Internet. 5. SSL is used for encrypting communication between browser and server. On the other hand, SSH is used for encrypting communication between two computers over the Internet. 6. In SSL, the communication is authenticated via the private-key/public-key pair. Whereas in SSH, the communication is authenticated via private-key/public-key pair or username/password pair. 7. Technically, SSH is for securing computer networks, whereas SSL is for securing online data transfers. 8. SSL generally (except exceptions) uses X.509 digital certificates for server and client authentication processes, whereas SSH does not. 9. Another major difference is that SSH has more built-in functionality than SSL. It helps in enabling users to log in to a server and execute commands remotely, whereas SSL does not have this functionality. To achieve this functionality, you need to pair it with another protocol like HTTP, FTP."

They are important for several reasons, most importantly because they allow designers to compress content on the home page. By compressing content, you fit more content in less space. This means that readers can scan headlines more quickly and that you can fit more information above the fold.\n\n\nMore after jump! Continue reading below \u2193\n\n\nAlso, \u201cRead more\u201d links allow website administrators to more easily track the most popular content. Designers who put entire articles on the home page may make it difficult for website administrators to track the most popular articles and understand what users want to see.\n\n\nThe third and probably most practical reason for having \u201cRead more\u201d links on a website is money. Websites that monetize traffic understand that the more their readers click on links, the more likely they will look at and click on advertisements. \u201cRead more\u201d links can double or even triple the number of page views a website receives, making it more attractive to advertisers."

Microwaving meat briefly before cooking at a high temperature reduces the time the meat needs to be cooked, and therefore less HCAs are produced. Although some studies how burnt, fried, or barbecued meat is associated with higher risk of certain cancers in lab tests, the connection between charred food and increased cancer risk is not proven for certain."

But the account-holders \u2014 all 30-odd million of them \u2014 are the ones who own that material. That\u2019s been how leaked or stolen material has been successfully taken down before, for example when celebrities\u2019 private photos were stolen from their phones in 2014.

However, emerging research indicates that the model of a single neural clock might be too simplistic. A new study, recently published in the Journal of Neuroscience by neuroscientists at the University of California, Irvine, reveals that the brain may in fact have a second method for sensing elapsed time. What\u2019s more, the authors propose that this second internal clock not only works in parallel with our primary neural clock, but may even compete with it.\n\n\nPast research suggested that a brain region called the striatum lies at the heart of our central inner clock, working with the brain\u2019s surrounding cortex to integrate temporal information."

                "text": "It has also been shown that the cerebellum plays a key role in motor tasks requiring perception of implicit timing. Other parts of the brain may be involved in implicit-timing estimates: for example, the left parietal cortex, which manages intended movement, and the left premotor cortex, which plans and organises movement. Sometimes the right prefrontal cortex, usually involved in explicit-timing estimates, is activated for implicit estimates, for instance, when an event does not occur as soon as expected: a traffic light stays red for longer than foreseen. The brain updates its time forecasts, once again anticipating the interval.\n\n\nIn addition, \"the regions of the brain involved differ depending on the context, particularly if the stimulus only lasts for a very short time, less than 200 milliseconds,\" says Coull. The visual cortex is activated when we estimate the duration of a visual stimulus. In the same way, the primary motor cortex comes into play when a timing estimate is associated with an action, whereas the auditory cortex has a part in estimating the length of a sound stimulus.\n\n\nAbove all, the brain's perception of time involves processes linked to memory and attention: witness the impression that time is passing more quickly when we are busy, or doing something amusing or exciting. Time flies even when we are in love. In contrast, a watched pot never boils. Minutes drag by when we are bored."

For example, A 10 megapixel (MP) camera may provide settings to take pictures in 10.2 MP (3872 x 2592), 5.6 MP (2896 x 1944), and 2.5 MP (1936 x 1296). A higher image size setting means a larger picture and bigger file size. A lower image size setting makes a smaller picture and smaller file size. Depending on your camera, there may be different sizes available.\n\n\nFile size: This is the amount of space that the image file takes up on your memory card, or internal memory if your camera has one. It is measured in megabytes. The actual file size depends on the image size and image quality settings selected on the camera.\n\n\nImage quality: This dictates how much compression is used to record the file information. Some digital cameras have a Fine and Standard setting where the Fine setting uses less compression than the Standard setting. Therefore, the detail of a picture taken with the Fine setting is a sharper than one taken with the Standard setting. Similar to the image size setting discussed above, this also affects the file size. Since the Fine setting uses less compression and records more detail, the file size will be larger than one recorded with the standard setting."

The consensus has been that a bicycle's stability is related to two factors: First, the rotating wheels of the bicycle provide stability through gyroscopic effects; secondly, that the \u2018trail\u2019, the distance by which the contact point of the front wheel trails behind the steering axis, plays an important part.\n\nA new study in Science claims to have settled the issue - gyroscopic effects and trail help, says researcher Dr Arend Schwab of the 3mE faculty at TU Delft, but are not necessary above a certain speed . In a 2007 Proceedings of the Royal Society article (doi:10.1098/rspa.2007.1857), a mathematical model with around 25 physical parameters was developed at the time which appeared to predict whether, and at what speeds, a particular design of bicycle would be stable."

                "text": "A bicycle, on the other hand, is statically unstable because it only has two contact points with the ground (whatever portion of the front and back wheels happen to be touching the ground) and its base of support is a line segment. A good base of support needs at least three contact points with the ground, so bikes are hard to keep upright when they're still. Bikes are, however, dynamically stable, or stable when moving forward, because steering allows a rider to move the bike's points of support around under the center of gravity and keep it balanced, often with steering adjustments small enough that the rider may not even realize they're making them. It's sort of like standing on one foot. If you don't hop around a little, and you start falling sideways, you can't recover and you fall over. If you do hop, though, you can move your foot around to keep your center of gravity above it and keep your balance.\n\n\nA bike has two features that help this dynamic stability immensely: its wheels. Spinning wheels have angular momentum, and when you're sitting on a bike, you and it and its wheels make up a system that obeys the principle of conservation of angular momentum. Unless torque, or twisting force, is applied from outside the system to change the wheels' angular momentum, that momentum and the direction of the momentum remain constant. In a nutshell, once the wheels line up a certain way, they want to stay lined up like that. It's easy for you to move them, but hard for an outside force to do the same, and so the bike is easy to keep balanced but doesn't topple easily. A non-moving bike has wheels that aren't spinning and zero angular momentum, which makes it very easy for external torque to change the wheels' direction, making the bike harder to balance."

But their importance is undeniable. \u201cThe development of these maps revolutionized how people perceived space, much like Google Earth has done in our lifetimes,\u201d Hessler says. \u201cUnderstanding how the technology was developed gives us insight into how we got here, and perhaps into where we\u2019re going.\u201d"

It appears they used neither a regular formula nor continuous direct observation to determine the length of the months. Most likely, they followed a general rule of alternating months (29 and 30 days long), subject to periodic correction by observation.\n\nIn addition to this calendar, which has been called the festival calendar, Athenians maintained a second calendar for the political year. This \"conciliar\" year divided the year into \"prytanies,\" one for each of the \"phylai,\" the subdivisions of Athenian citizens. The number of phylai, and hence the number of prytanies, varies over time. Until 307 BCE, there were 10 phylai.\n\nAfter that the number varies between 11 and 13 (usually 12). Even more confusing, while the conciliar and festival years were basically the same length in the 4th century BCE, such was not regularly the case earlier or later. Thus documents dated by prytany are frequently very difficult to assign to a particular equivalent in the Julian calendar, although we are usually secure in assigning an approximate date"

We can establish a precise correlation to the common era from a variety of different sources, but the most definitive comes from a passage in Diodorus, where he dates the year of a total solar eclipse to the reign of the Athenian archon Hieromnemon, which he also gives as Ol. 117,3.

As time went on, dentistry (and ophthalmology, to some degree) was regarded as less advanced than medicine, which seeped into the minds of Congress while they formulated public health insurance policies in the 1960s. As just one example of the general sentiment during those times, in 1940, an appellate court in New York decided that dentists weren\u2019t doctors, and thus not deserving of the same prestige."

Luckily, many birds can also navigate by the position of the stars in the sky once night rolls around. Constellations guided many sailors at night before modern technology came along. Birds can use the stars as navigational aids in the same way.\n\n\nBirds also have the benefit of a bird's eye view. Human hikers lost in the woods sometimes must climb to the top of the nearest mountain to be able to see natural or man-made landscape features, like roads or coastlines, to find their way home. Birds just take to the sky where they get an awesome view of everything below them. Sometimes traveling south is as simple as following the path of a river that travels south to warmer temperatures.\n\n\nFinally, some scientists believe some birds may also get some of their guidance from Earth's magnetic field. Some species of birds have a highly-magnetic mineral called magnetite in their brains. Experts believe this mineral may help birds detect Earth's magnetic field and use it to guide them south."

If the truck containing the piece isn\u2019t insulated during transport, consider how it can be packaged to provide extra insulation. Moving blankets are an excellent way to provide extra padding and insulation.\n\n\n### Give Items Plenty of Space\n\n\nPacking strategically is important anytime you move, but for museum quality pieces ample space is often needed. Instead of cramming everything in together like sardines to save space, heirlooms, artifacts and artwork may actually benefit from extra space.\n\n\nIf there\u2019s any chance that friction or contact could damage a museum piece it\u2019s placed in a crate or special packaging. Museums have even had to construct mounts, trays and supports to stabilize artifacts before they\u2019re moved. When that\u2019s not possible, the item is adequately secured in place and given plenty of room in the moving truck.\n\n\n### Special Packaging for Documents\n\n\nEven the documentation that authenticates a historical artifact or art piece is a vital item that has to be handled and packed with care. When you\u2019re moving files moisture is again a top concern, but physical damage can also easily occur if documents aren\u2019t packaged appropriately.\n\n\nFile boxes are designed to securely hold thousands of letter or legal size documents. File folders can also be used in the boxes to keep documents in order without causing any damage.\n\n\n### Limit Light and UV Exposure"

                "text": "* Oxidizing drain cleaners contain substances such as household bleach, peroxides and nitrates. These chemicals cause the organic material of the clog to lose electrons and become oxidized. The product is heavier than water, so it can move through standing water, and it releases heat and gas to help clear the blockage. * Acid drain cleaners aren't commonly found in stores, and some are sold only to plumbers. These typically contain high concentrations of sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid, substances that increase hydronium ions in a solution and attract electrons from the clog. The hydronium ions react chemically with the material in the clog, and the reaction releases heat, which is necessary to melt congealed grease [source: Sheridan]."

All chemical reactions involve moving electrons, and drain cleaners work by either taking or giving electrons to the clogging substance, generating heat in the process. There are three main types of drain cleaners:\n\n * Caustic drain cleaners contain substances such as lye and caustic potash. They're bases, so they give electrons to the clogging substance, and their hydroxide ions create the reaction that clears the clog. Their alkaline, or basic, chemicals release heat and turn grease into a soap-like substance that's more easily dissolved. These drain cleaners are typically heavier than water, which enables them to reach the clog through standing water."

These compounds combine to produce propanethial S-oxide, an irritating gas.\n\n\nPropanethial S-oxide is a lachrymatory agent, meaning that it generates tears when it touches the eye. Propanethial S-oxide turns into sulfuric acid when it touches the water layer that covers and protects your eyeballs.\n\n\nBut just like onions, your eyes are also equipped with a defense mechanism meant to protect them from harm. When the nerves in each eye detect a lachrymatory agent, they generate tears to flush it out."

Other than that, it's pretty safe on your eyes.

Some sharks can identify blood a quarter-mile away, but the scent doesn\u2019t reach them instantaneously or necessarily cause them to attack.\n\n\n[Image: blue shark nostrils]\n\n\nSharks have a heightened sense of smell and olfactory system that is hundreds of times stronger than a human\u2019s. Their nostrils, located beneath their snouts, are used only for smelling and not for breathing. They do have the capacity to detect tiny amounts of various compounds in the water. Some types of sharks, such as the lemon shark, can even detect a scent in a large swimming pool or a substance that is several hundred meters away.\n\n\nBut a shark more than a quarter-mile away won\u2019t smell your blood and decide to make you into a yummy snack. Smells reach a shark through the currents, and it would take time for the scent to travel that distance to a shark\u2019s nostrils. The motion of the ocean carries smell molecules with it, so, the more motion, the faster the smell will travel.\n\n\nIf you do start to bleed while swimming in the ocean, there is some time to get safely to shore in case a rogue shark decides to attack."

No firewall works perfectly, and a lot of a firewall's effectiveness depends on how you configure it.\n\n\nTo get a basic grasp of how firewalls work, it's important to understand how TCP packets work.\n\n\nThe data that your computer sends and receives over the internet or an internal network is comprised of TCP packets and UDP packets. TCP packets can be more effectively filtered by firewalls because they contain more information in their headers.\n\n\n[Image]\n\n\nTCP packets contain information such as source and destination addresses, packet sequence information, and payload. That information allows your network interface to deliver data properly, and a firewall can compare that information to the rules you configured it with. For example, all HTTPS data is transmitted through TCP packets. When HTTPS data is sent to your computer through your network interface while you surf the web, your operating system will know that it's data that's supposed to go to your web browser. The same applies if you are surfing the web - on your phone, on your PC, or even on a server machine in your datacenter. With the proliferation of the Internet of Things, you might even be surfing the web from a touchscreen embedded in your refrigerator. Your HTTPS data is used the same way regardless."

Nor do all Kurds share a religious identity: Though the majority of Kurds are Sunni Muslims, other religions are practiced as well.\n\n\nWhat is clear is a Kurdish ethnic identity and common language. Those commonalities emerged around the Middle Ages. Since then, Kurds have played roles in the histories of what are now Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey.\n\n\nBut while they flourished and wielded influence in the region, Kurds lost their lands when the Ottoman Empire took over most Kurdish-held territory in the 1500s."

The phrase \u201cagnosticism\u201d was first used by Thomas Henry Huxley against religious people who accused him of denouncing the role of God in the creation of the universe. Huxley supported the theories of evolution by Charles Darwin and did not subscribe to religious beliefs. He believed that nature was too diverse to have been created and that natural selection provided a better explanation provable by evidence. Huxley thought that agnosticism was a principle and not a belief. He reiterated that it is wrong for one to claim a phenomenon is a definite truth unless logical evidence is provided. The word was coined as the antagonist of the phrase \u201cGnosticism,\u201d meaning \u201cknowledge.\u201d Gnosticism was a religious ideology in the first and second centuries that suggested that the material world was ungodly while the spirit world was the better choice. Although agnosticism was not intended to raise the question of whether God exists or not, it found its way to the religious world. Huxley justified his stand by claiming that he did not deny or affirm the mortality or human and therefore, did not see the reason to believe or disprove the existence of God. He challenged the religious and atheists to prove or disprove the presence of God."

In addition, not enough people in these countries understand how the disease is spread and how to keep it from spreading to others.\n\nThe CDC is trying to make sure that people who appear sick do not get on a plane to come to the US. They are also screening people arriving from countries known to have Ebola. Finally, even if someone does develop Ebola after returning to the US, our public health system has a strong ability to track people and their contacts. Our health care system has plenty of supplies, medicines, doctors, and nurses with the know-how to treat and stop it from spreading."

A heavier case is often a better choice than a lightweight case in order to cut down on vibration and noise when the fans are running. Larger cases are easier to cool as well, thus allowing for additional hard drives and other components down the line. Be aware that larger fans for an ATX case will usually generate more noise than fans within a Micro ATX case, so look for case fans that are specifically marketed as silent."

                "text": "## Mechanical Advantage in Biomechanics\n\nIt may seem confusing that most of the muscles in the human body are 3rd class levers, since these levers are at a mechanical disadvantage in terms of effort versus load. However, this only holds true in terms of resistance. The opposite is true when you consider the distal lever displacement. A small arc of motion proximally at the muscle insertion will create large angular displacement and velocity distally. Since most human movement is aimed at maximizing angular displacement of a distal segment through space, the use of 3rd class levers for is very efficient.\n\nThis creates a relationship between the lever arm distance, distal angular displacement/velocity, and torque production. The shorter the lever arm of the effort force (decreased mechanical advantage), the greater angular displacement and angular velocity of the distal end of the lever for a given arc of displacement of the effort force. The larger the lever arm of the effort force (increased mechanical advantage), the increased torque production.\n\nThis lever arm and force/torque production relationship needs to be taken into consideration when assessing movement and prescribing interventions. For example, applying a 5 pound weight at the distal end of a lever during a scaption/SLR exercise creates a mechanical disadvantage for the supraspinatus/illiopsoas. This results in the muscle being overloaded in attempt to create the amount of torque necessary for the distal angular displacement."

Differentiation describes how the value of a function changes with respect to its variables. Integration is the inverse, in that it gives the exact summation of a function between two values. Integral calculus provides an exact means of calculating the area under the curve of a mathematical function. Integration has a wide range of applications in physics and engineering."

However, these countries contain around 38 percent of the world\u2019s total natural gas reserves and 48 percent of the total known reserves of crude oil (Sorkhabi, 2010). When people think about the Middle East, they think about oil. According to 2020 data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, around 27 percent of the world\u2019s current oil production is sourced from this region. For as long as fossil fuels have been a primary source of global energy, the Middle East has been one of the world\u2019s foremost oil and gas suppliers. Because of the region\u2019s ability to produce and sell massive quantities of oil and gas, economic development in the Middle East has largely been fueled by the fossil fuel industry."

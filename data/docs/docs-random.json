It commonly occurs when warm air near the surface of the Earth rises due to convection\u2013in the classic case, on a sunny summer day when the ground gets hot and warms up the air immediately above it. As the hot air rises, cooler air descends to replace it. If conditions are right, strong updrafts can form that quickly move the warm, humid surface air up to the higher reaches of the troposphere, where the water vapor in the air cools and condenses to fall as rain (or ice, if it\u2019s cold enough). These updrafts are a hallmark of thunderstorms\u2013the strong upward motion of the air encourages the interactions between water droplets and ice crystals that can lead to lightning. In winter, cold surface air temperatures and reduced sunlight mean there\u2019s less surface heating, less convection, and thus fewer opportunities for thunderstorms."

These storms can occur when it is cold at the surface, but there is a warm layer higher up in the atmosphere that provides the energy to the storms.\n\n\nElavated thunderstorms occur a lot on the north side of a warm front, where warm air is surging in above our heads, but the warm air at the surface hasn't quite made it into the area yet.\n\n\nEver wonder why these elevated storms seem to have long, drawn-out thunder compared to thunderstorms that occur when it's warm at the surface? With cold air at the surface and warm air above it, the warm air will act as a kind of ceiling, or insulator, to things like sound waves. The sound waves from thunder will hit the bottom of the warm air layer and will bounce back to the ground, which causes the sound of thunder to last much longer."

This brief overview of integral calculus serves to explain how integrals are used to perform these calculations. For the purposes of this overview, only the calculation of areas will be explained. Integral calculus can also be used to calculate volumes, but the math becomes more complicated.\n\n\nIntegrals are used to find the area under a curve on a graph, where the curve is represented by an algebraic function, such as \u201cx + 2\u201d. The area is bound at the top by the function, at the bottom by the x-axis, and on the sides by whatever boundaries you choose, which we shall call endpoints. Performing the integral function from the left endpoint to the right endpoint is the mathematical way of computing the area inside of the boundaries. An integral is an exact calculation of the specified area, but to understand the concept, it is helpful to start with an approximation."

Seismologists can therefore compare the size of the different types of wave to try to determine whether the waves came from an explosion or a natural earthquake."

Companies that are transparent use salary bands to identify the range of a position within their organization, or the company\u2019s intranet, as mentioned earlier.\n\n\nAnother way is to utilize your human resources department and allow employees to privately approach them for that information.\n\n\nIf secret salaries are the biggest obstacle to getting competitive pay information from your employer, then you need to start getting comfortable with asking what others are making.\n\n\nWhen you start talking about money and what others make, provide some context around the reasons for needing this information. Let them know the purpose behind your inquiry and that this conversation will be kept confidential.\n\n\nYou may find that some have old-fashioned beliefs about discussing their salary, even younger generations. Although, if you want to further yourself and get the appropriate pay, you need to change your straightforward approach. Do this by being less direct and more conversational about the topic."

But why does this happen?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn fact, the reason onions make us cry can be traced back to the soil. Onions are part of the \u201cGenus Allium\u201d plant family, along with garlic, leeks and chives, and they absorb sulfur from the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we cut into an onion, we break its cells, releasing the contents inside. This allows chemicals that were previously separated by a cell membrane to combine with each other and with the air. Enzymes and \u201camino acid sulfoxide\u201d chemicals from inside the cells react to produce a volatile sulfur gas. This gas wafts up from the onion and reacts with the natural water in your eye to form sulfuric acid, which brings about the familiar stinging sensation."

They tend to associate vegetables with less positive memories, such as nagging parents and unpleasant meals during which they are forced to eat green stuff.

The sour and bitter flavors alert us to foods that might be toxic or harmful to us.\n\n\nVegetables, although very healthy, do have a component of bitterness to them. This could be from a low level of toxins created by the plant to avoid being eaten, or a kind of bitterness camouflage to make an animal think the plant is toxic.\n\n\nSince children in general have more sensitive taste buds than adults, designed to protect their more sensitive digestive systems, they\u2019re not fond of bitter flavors.

They modelled a mechanism for measuring time, a sort of internal clock. It consists of a pacemaker, continuously emitting pulses (ticking), which are stored in an accumulator. The subjective duration of time depends on the number of pulses that have accumulated (since the beginning of the stimulus). When the internal clock speeds up, the number of pulses increases, creating the impression that time is passing more slowly."

                "text": "At the beginning of the century, Professor Warren Meck, at the Duke Institute for Brain Science, North Carolina, developed a more physiologically realistic model. According to the striatal beat-frequency model of interval timing, the representation of time is underpinned by the oscillatory activity of brain cells in the upper cortex. The activity of each oscillator cell is characterised by a specific rhythm. The frequency of oscillations is detected by certain cells in the dorsal striatum, a substructure of the basal ganglia, located at the base of the forebrain.\n\n\n\"Each of these brain cells has up to 30,000 connections with a series of cells in the cortex oscillating at various frequencies. The neurons in the striatum can read time codes emitted by oscillator cells in the cortex. They come into action when oscillatory activity corresponds to previously detected patterns, stored in memory,\" Meck explains.\n\n\nAlongside this model, in which estimates of time intervals originate in neuronal activity, the brain structures involved in processing time-related data differ depending on whether they are estimating the duration of a stimulus (explicit timing) or gauging the lapse of time, or interval, separating us from an event expected to occur in a few seconds or minutes ("

There are a few ways in which this can happen.\n\n\nFirst of all, the phase of a material (whether it is gas, liquid, or solid) depends strongly on both its temperature and pressure. For most liquids, applying pressure raises the temperature at which the liquid freezes to solid. A solid is formed when the loose, meandering molecules of a liquid get slow enough and close enough to form stable bonds that pin them in place. When we apply pressure to a liquid, we force the molecules to get closer together. They can therefore form stable bonds and become a solid even if they have a higher temperature than the freezing point at standard pressure."

The density of liquid water is determined by its temperature, and water is most dense at about 40 F.\n\n\nWhy is that important? As winter sets in, lakes lose energy to the atmosphere, and water near the surface cools, becomes more dense, and sinks. Warmer, less dense water under the surface will rise to replace this surface water. When the entire lake reaches 40 F, the surface water cools further, dropping below 40 F. Because this water is now less dense than the surrounding water, it will stay on the top and continue to cool.\n\n\nOnce the surface water falls to 32 F, it freezes. The freezing then spreads downward into the lake and the ice thickens. Unless the lake is very shallow, you will find liquid water below the ice. This deeper water is about 40 F; fortunately fish can live in this cold temperature."

This top layer of water interfaces with the cold air, which cools the top of the lake even further until it freezes."

Sure enough, it would be its most natural state. But actually if you cool down some very pure, very steady water, you can pretty easily get... a very cold liquid below 0\u00b0C. This is all because in order for the water molecules to re-arrange into Crystal of ice, they need some support to rely on, a little seed to grow around (we call that a nucleus). So if there is no impurity in that water, then you can cool it down without freezing it ! You have to be careful to keep it steady too, because the energy of a shock would give the kick it needs to start the crystallization."

                "text": "A very small percentage of white bikers who wear swastikas do so because they are racist (usually not Anti-Semitic though). A slightly larger percentage do so because there is an identification in that subculture, even amongst non-White Motorcyclists, with the swastika as the ultimate \"evil\" or \"badness\". Also the fact that the Swastika is associated with very brutal, violent, and ultimately self-destructed movement appeals to a certain warrior ethic in the biker subculture. Most however simply wear it as a \"leave me alone\" deterrent. Bikers get a lot of attention, from people trying to test how tough they are, or people gawking, taking pictures, etc. If someone puts with a big swastika on their jacket or helmet, what better symbol would immediately communicate \"leave me the **** alone,\" more efficiently?"

Puritan customs, commercial spirit and the general ostentatious hypocrisy of ordinary Americans did not cohere with the notion of the great American dream, which was defended by former soldiers. Many of these people could not find themselves in a society that was alien to them. Some of those individuals saddled motorcycles, dressed in black leather and started decorating their steel horses with trophy swastikas and iron crosses as a protest against the government. Soon they began to unite in motorcycle clubs and live by the old front principles. Since then, the Iron Cross has taken a new place in history. It became one of the main symbols of bikers and motorcycle customizers around the world. You can find crosses in many elements of biker culture, from the colors to cross rings, pendants and other jewelry. Today The Iron Cross personifies itself as belonging to the world of choppers, to the world of independence and freedom."

It\u2019s a full-bodied malted barley beer with 5 percent ABV, similar in strength to Leo, although this beer has a distinctively rich taste with a strong hops character. Singha Light is made from the same quality ingredients but contains less alcohol\u20143.5 percent ABV\u2014and it has a surprisingly smooth and uniquely refreshing taste.\n\n\nBoon Rawd did experiment with brewing the beer overseas and bought two German breweries in Hartmannsdorf and Mittweida in Saxony in 1994. Singha Gold for the European market was produced at these breweries until 2001. It was then decided that for a truly authentic Thai taste, the beer had to be brewed in Thailand. Brewing of Singha beer ceased in Germany, and now all brands are produced only in Thailand to ensure that the original taste is worldwide."

Gleeking is more likely when the salivary gland has been recently stimulated, but even a residual amount of saliva in the gland may be released by gleeking.\n\n\nGleeking may occur spontaneously due to accidental tongue pressure on the sublingual gland while talking, eating, yawning, or cleaning the teeth. Gleeking can also be induced, for instance, by pressing the underside of the tongue against the palate, then pushing the tongue forward while simultaneously closing the lower jaw and moving it slightly forward; or by yawning deeply and pressing the tongue against the palate. Practice is usually required to induce gleeking consistently, and induction is more likely to be successful under conditions of salivary stimulation (e.g. by certain types of food)."

Just as snowflakes form around microscopic dirt particles, explains Xin, so too do particles in a battery require these irregularities to form upon.\n\n\nThe cathode doesn't escape charge-reducing effects, either.\n\n\nHere, as lithium ions move across the electrode when charging, they form a kind of rock-salt, which acts as an electrically-insulating crust. The thicker this crust, the less charge the battery will accept. Xin says this latter effect is even more pronounced at higher voltages."

(Image credit: Ice image via <a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com\" target=\"_blank\">Shutterstock</a>)\n\n\nCurious children, and adults with lots of free time on their hands, often notice that apparently clear water sometimes produces oddly clouded ice cubes. The main reason is that the (hopefully) crystal-clear water you pour into the ice trays is not as pure as it seems, containing small amounts of (hopefully) harmless suspended minerals and sediment.\n\n\nBecause all objects freeze from the outside in, the center of the cube is the last to solidify. Water free of minerals and impurities freezes first, pushing the cloudy parts containing the sediment (and tiny trapped air bubbles) toward the center. The result is a harmless (but not particularly photogenic) ice cube clouding."

It\u2019s why fish can breathe in it. Scientists measure dissolved oxygen in streams to determine how healthy the environment is. When the water flows from your tap, it tends to be pretty well oxygenated also.\n\n\nAs the water freezes, it wants to form a regular crystalline structure (ice). That means impurities like oxygen and other dissolved gasses are pushed away from the crystallization front into the remaining liquid. This means that the last parts of the ice cube to crystallize end up with most of the impurities. If you\u2019ll take a look at your home made ice cubes, you\u2019ll note that the parts of the ice cube that were at the bottom of the tray are the milky colored bits. That\u2019s because those were the last parts to freeze.

McKenzie compares it to holding your thumb over a garden hose: \u201cBlocking part of the hose [increases] the pressure of the water inside, [causing] the water leaving to spray out at an even greater velocity.\u201d When you start to pump gas, the pipe, which has been \u201cblocked\u201d like the hose, releases the air quickly. \u201cThis expelled air brings with it a pressure that\u2019s strong enough to hold the valve in the open position,\u201d McKenzie says.\n\n\nSo that\u2019s what happens while you\u2019re filling up your tank. And once it\u2019s full of gas, gasoline, not air, now reaches the pipe inside the nozzle, which evens out the pressure. As McKenzie explains, this creates \u201ca small suctioning force (known as the Venturi effect) that switches the valve to the off position.\u201d"

Everything is going to fly to the front.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Once the wave reaches a certain height, it begins to crest over itself and break creating the whitewash.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce a wave has broken it will continue to lose speed and power as it travels toward the shore. This is why you will see experienced surfers riding the waves before they begin to crest or break and beginner surfers riding the whitewash closer towards the shore."

Much of the explanation for this question is still unknown, but research has shown that the brain is trained to know what to feel when a person moves or performs any function. We aren't aware of a lot of the sensations generated by our movements. For example, you probably don't pay much attention to your vocal cords when you speak. For the same reason, we can't tickle ourselves. If we grab our sides in an attempt to tickle ourselves, our brain anticipates this contact from the hands and prepares itself for it. By taking away the feeling of unease and panic, the body no longer responds the same as it would if someone else were to tickle us."

The wheels of the bike each have their own angular momentum vectors, which like to stay pointed in the same direction, and hence resist tipping from side to side (sort of like a gyroscope).\n\n2. Since the bike is moving, any tipping to one side or the other can easily be corrected by turning the front wheel slightly to one side and getting a mv^2/r force that will tend to counteract the tipping. The greater the bike's velocity, the bigger this force is.\n\n3. Something to do with speed making it easier for a rider to orient his/her center of mass in line with the frame of the bike.

Spinning wheels have angular momentum, and when you're sitting on a bike, you and it and its wheels make up a system that obeys the principle of conservation of angular momentum. Unless torque, or twisting force, is applied from outside the system to change the wheels' angular momentum, that momentum and the direction of the momentum remain constant. In a nutshell, once the wheels line up a certain way, they want to stay lined up like that. It's easy for you to move them, but hard for an outside force to do the same, and so the bike is easy to keep balanced but doesn't topple easily. A non-moving bike has wheels that aren't spinning and zero angular momentum, which makes it very easy for external torque to change the wheels' direction, making the bike harder to balance."

There, specialized photoreceptive structures called rods and cones convert these photons into electromagnetic impulses that your brain interprets as shapes, colors, and textures.\n\n\nYour lens changes shape in order to focus on things both near and far. However, there are limits to its flexibility. When something is blurry, it usually means the light being focused by your lens is either under- or overshooting the focal point at the back of your retina (though blurriness can also be caused by physical damage to your eyeball).\n\n\nThe light from the thing you are trying to look at is also competing with light from everything else in your field of view.

That\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t appear to drip; the snowball becomes a slushball. The black scorch marks are actually from the lighters themselves. Butane is a hydrocarbon, a molecule made up of carbon and hydrogen. When you burn it, the molecule reacts with oxygen in the air, breaking the bonds between atoms, and reforming new molecules. If the burning were perfect, all you\u2019d have left is carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H20).\n>\n> But the burning is never completely perfect, and you get other stuff too. One thing that happens is that some of the carbon molecules reform into long chains, creating what we call soot.

Soap can bond to the oil molecules and then pull them away from a surface as it is carried off by water. The soap molecules will pry oil molecules off of surfaces and suspend them within water, which can now wash them away.\n\n\nSoap also has another function. Soap can decrease the surface tension of water, which allows water molecules to bond easier with a surface, sticking to what needs to be cleaned rather than simply running off of it. Surface tension happens because of the bonds that molecules of water form with other molecules of water. When soap is on a surface along with water the water molecules can spread farther and clean more deeply. These processes are how soap works to make washing away grease and oils that much easier. (Soap can also wash away the oils in your skin, which is why your hands get chapped if you wash them too much.)"

These oils are very difficult to get rid of without soap because water is a polar molecule. This means that water bonds more easily with itself than other types of molecules, like molecules of oil. Oil molecules don\u2019t have poles and they have different electric charges as well, which means that oil will just remain behind as water clumps together and runs off of it."

It can become addicted to any activity or substance that consistently produces dopamine.\""

Dr. Renee Carr, Psy.D, a clinical psychologist, says it's due to the chemicals being released in our brain. \"When engaged in an activity that's enjoyable such as binge watching, your brain produces dopamine,\" she explains. \"This chemical gives the body a natural, internal reward of pleasure that reinforces continued engagement in that activity. It is the brain's signal that communicates to the body, 'This feels good. You should keep doing this!'

By this definition, common forms of sigma bonds are s+s, p_z+p_z, s+p_z and d z^2+d z^2 (where z is defined as the axis of the bond or the internuclear axis).[2] Quantum theory also indicates that molecular orbitals (MO) of identical symmetry actually mix or hybridize. As a practical consequence of this mixing of diatomic molecules, the wavefunctions s+s and p_z+p_z molecular orbitals become blended. The extent of this mixing (or hybridization or blending) depends on the relative energies of the MOs of like symmetry."

The reason is that the overlapping of atomic orbitals can take place to a greater extent during the formation of a sigma bond, whereas overlapping of orbitals occurs to a smaller extent during the formation of a pi bond.\n\n\nA pi bond between two atoms is formed only in addition to a sigma bond. The reason is that the atoms constituting a single bond prefer to form a strong sigma bond rather than a weak pi bond.\n\n\nThus, a pi bond is always present in molecules with multiple bonds, i.e., double or triple bonds. In other words, a single bond cannot be a pi bond.\n\n\nThere can be free rotation of atoms around the sigma bonds. Free rotation of atoms around pi bonds is not possible because it involves breaking the pi bonds."

The bacteria thrive in different temperature ranges and result in different kinds of cheese.

The chemical process that turns dairy milk into cheese makes it possible for the cheese to be made on a large scale and sold as a commercial product."

It takes a few hours at the correct temperature for most cheeses to form.\n\n\nOnce the cheese curds are formed, many kinds of cheese are drained, pressed, shaped, and then aged to allow moisture to escape and flavor to develop. During the aging process, exposure to oxygen causes the cheese to create a rind, which is a hard outer layer.\n\n\nRennet is required to make aged cheeses because it contains long protein chains that break down slowly, which allows lactic acid to develop smoky, floral, fruity, and nutty flavors. In cheesemaking, the term \u201cterroir\u201d refers to the process of adding mold cultures, like in bleu cheese, for more variety of flavor."

There are people in the realm who continue to adhere to animist beliefs who are not followers of any of the main world religions. The oldest world religions of India are Hinduism and Buddhism. Other important religions in the realm include Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, Zoroastrianism, Jainism, and the Baha\u2019i faith. India is at times labeled a Hindu state, but the accuracy of the label is dubious. A more suitable way to describe India is to say that it is a secular country where approximately 80 percent of the population follows Hindu traditions. Islam is the second-most popular religion, practiced by about 13 percent of the population. Christianity is India\u2019s third-largest religion, practiced by about 3 percent of the population. Sikhism accounts for about 2 percent of the population of India. Buddhism and Jainism are two other minority religions that have their origins in South Asia. And finally, there are still Indians who practice animist religions that predate all the other religions listed, especially in remote areas."

Measuring a 17-inch (43-centimeter) LCD monitor, Schindler found that white required 22.6 watts, while black came in a tad higher at 23.2 watts.

That shouldn't be surprising. We all know that time flies when you're having fun. When you are cognitively busy, you are focused on each task you are performing, and so you don't have the opportunity to notice the passage of time. As a result, the interval feels like it passes quickly. When you are bored, there is not much to occupy your time, and you are much more likely to think about the passage of time. So time feels like it passes slowly when not much is happening.\n\n\nWhen you look back on time periods, though, things reverse. How can you decide how long a time period was in retrospect? You have to retrieve events from memory in order to judge durations. When you think back on an interesting time that had lots of new experiences, you are able to retrieve a lot"

With that in mind, each person marked how far away they felt the beginning and end of their weekends were on a scale from zero (very near) to 100 (very far).\n\n\nResults show people expecting to have a great weekend felt their fun was much farther away and would last only a short time. On the scale, these participants placed the start and end of their weekends in almost the same spot. In fact, 46 percent of people preparing for a fun weekend felt it had no duration at all.\n\n\nConversely, participants thinking about a terrible weekend believed it was much closer to the present day and would last much longer.

An air-filled tired can experience and adjust to multiple deformations per second, absorbing the shock, so drivers hardly feel the effects of striking a small obstacle, unlike these guys\u2026\n\nFurthermore, inflated rubber tires also offer a lower rolling resistance (i.e. such tires minimize wasted energy as a tire rolls, which, in turn, decreases the required rolling effort), which is another plus in favor of inflated rubber tires."

The fact is, most people do not replace their tires as a result of punctures and flat tires, but rather because the tread wears down, thinning the rubber and making the tires unable to hold traction on the road.\n\nSolid rubber tires, particularly when driven at high speeds, would face the exact same problems of tread loss, at a faster rate, and due to the solid composition of the tires, would cost more to produce and dispose of, while also adding weight to the car as a whole, requiring more fuel expenditure."

So inflated wheels at 4 atmospheres guarantee that the wheels are more rigid and the ride is smoother.\n\n\nThis advantage becomes more important at higher speeds because the wheel could get deformed many times a second at higher speeds. And it becomes more important for greater vehicles (relatively to toys) because their mass grows as $R^3$ with the radius $R$ while the area of the wheel is expected to grow as $R^2$ only.

                "text": "The simplest way to change the duration or pitch of an audio recording is to change the playback speed. For a digital audio recording, this can be accomplished through sample rate conversion. Unfortunately, the frequencies in the recording are always scaled at the same ratio as the speed, transposing its perceived pitch up or down in the process. Slowing down the recording to increase duration also lowers the pitch, speeding it up for a shorter duration also raises the pitch creating the Chipmunk effect. Thus the two effects cannot be separated when using this method. A drum track containing no pitched instruments can be moderately sample-rate converted to adjust tempo without adverse effects, but a pitched track cannot."

A 2012 study of twins found a link between three gene variants and the aversion to cilantro. Identical twins usually shared their views of cilantro while the likes of fraternal twins varied as much as for non-twin siblings.\n\n\nAnother study from 2012 used data from 23andMe to look at the genetic codes of over 30,000 people, comparing whether they described cilantro as enjoyable or soapy. A single nucleotide gene variant in a cluster of olfactory receptor genes on chromosome 11 was strongly associated with the differing taste for cilantro. One of these genes, OR6A2, is specific for binding the aldehydes found in cilantro. However, the researchers noted that carrying the genes did not guarantee a dislike for cilantro.\n\n\nSo what gives? Taste preferences influenced by both nurture and nature.

Recently, Hashibe et al [7] carried out an epidemiological analysis of marijuana smoking and cancer. A connection between marijuana smoking and lung or colorectal cancer was not observed. These conclusions are reinforced by the recent work of Tashkin and coworkers [8] who were unable to demonstrate a cannabis smoke and lung cancer link, despite clearly demonstrating cannabis smoke-induced cellular damage."

                "text": "Smoke from tobacco and cannabis contains many of the same carcinogens and tumor promoters [20,21]. However, cannabis and tobacco have additional pharmacological activities, both receptor-dependent and independent, that result in different biological endpoints. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons found in smoke are pro-carcinogens that are converted to carcinogens by the enzymatic activity of the cytochrome P4501A1 oxidase protein (CYP1A1 gene product). Benzo [a] pyrene is converted to its carcinogenic metabolite diol epoxide, which binds to specific hyper-mutable nucleotide sequences in the K-ras oncogene and p53 tumor suppressor [22]. Recent work by Roth et al. demonstrates that THC treatment of murine hepatoma cells caused a dose dependent increase in CYP1A1 gene transcription, while at the same time directly inhibiting the enzymatic activity of the gene product [23]. Thus, despite potentially higher levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons found in cannabis smoke compared to tobacco smoke (dependent on what part of the plant is smoked), the THC present in cannabis smoke should exert a protective effect against pro-carcinogens that require activation. In contrast,"

It can be done by downshifting through the gears (besides first gear) to use the engine's braking capabilities while using the brakes. Right as you are about to come to a stop, put the car into neutral to avoid stalling. It is recommended that you learn to downshift, but some people just put the in neutral in order to brake."

It has also been shown to be applicable to\ufeff a wide variety of animals, from early-branching metazoans to primates. Genome-wide screens in model organisms have been performed, accurate models of human diseases have been constructed, and potential therapies have been tested and validated in animal models. Several achievements in genetic modification of animals have been translated into products for the agricultural and pharmaceutical industries. Based on the remarkable progress to date, one may anticipate that in the future, CRISPR\u2013Cas9 technology will enable additional far-reaching advances, including understanding the bases of diseases with complex genetic origins, engineering animals to produce organs for human transplantation, and genetically transforming entire populations of organisms to prevent the spread of disease."

Each electrochemical cell consists of two electrodes separated by an electrolyte.\n\n\nSo where does an electrochemical cell get its electricity from? To answer this question, we need to know what electricity is. Most simply, electricity is a type of energy produced by the flow of electrons. In an electrochemical cell, electrons are produced by a chemical reaction that happens at one electrode (more about electrodes below!) and then they flow over to the other electrode where they are used up. To understand this properly, we need to have a closer look at the cell's components, and how they are put together."

Some smells are easier to detect and process in a fast-moving airstream like the decongested nostril, while others are better detected in the slower airstream of the congested nostril. Nasal cycling also seems to keep the nose maintained for its function as an air filter and humidifier.

The newer socket style may also be required under the building code.\n\n\nThe bathroom shaver socket is mounted in an isolation transformer that cuts it off from the rest of the electrical system. This limits the risk of electrical shock, a concern in the bathroom where lots of water can be present. In addition, the current is very low. It will power a shaver or electric toothbrush, but not an item like a heater or a hair dryer. The circuit will shut down if it gets too hot, thus keeping the user as safe as possible."

So, the Julian calendar many countries felt wasn't a true year so they made the change.\n\n\nThe Gregorian calendar was able to make up for this 11 minute difference by not making years divisible by 100 to be a leap year.

However, the country did not decriminalize drug trafficking, involving larger quantities of drugs. Moreover, while individuals caught using drugs are not incarcerated, they may be fined, given community service, or referred to treatment programs.\n\n\nAccording to Portugal drug decriminalization statistics, drug overdose deaths declined after decriminalization, drug usage did not go up, and prison overcrowding decreased. However, stats supporting a Portugal drug decriminalization failure show an initial increase in drug experimentation and a 41 percent spike in homicides, which fell after the first five years.\n\n\nHence, the results appear to be mixed.

This occurs when a vulnerable service responds with a large reply when the attacker sends his request, often called the trigger packet.

The fluid squeezes a series of plates together inside a clutch pack to connect the engine to the transmission output shaft and route power to the wheels.\n\n\nIn a properly functioning transmission, this all happens instantly and goes largely unnoticed.\n\n\nHowever, fluid that\u2019s too thick (its viscosity is too high) can fail to flow quickly for crisp, confident shifts. That\u2019s one reason automatic transmission fluid has a lower viscosity than manual transmission fluid."

Requirements for better fluid durability, as expressed by tougher oxidation tests, have essentially eliminated Group I base stocks from ATF application. To provide the desired shift properties, one of the additives present in the oil is typically a long-chain hydrocarbon that has a polar group on one end. The long-chain hydrocarbon portion permits the additive to dissolve in oil, and the polar group on the end is attracted to metal surfaces and provides the desired amount of friction [33]. The various types of ATF differ in the fluid\u2019s friction characteristics"

The cost of publishing a daily paper, especially in the largest cities, began growing to the point that party subsidies no longer covered operating costs. Even more, the presence of new revenue sources, specifically department stores and other retailers, more than made up for old party subsidies. Yet these new advertisers all but insisted that editors expand their reach, and be less partisan.[ix]\n\n\nSuch considerations drove most, though not all, newspapers to present the news more objectively. Newspapers did not march in lock step, especially in the 1930s, when the Chicago Tribune made no effort to disguise its distaste for Franklin Roosevelt. There were other holdouts, including, for many years, the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\nStill, I would argue that by the 1950s most newspapers, large and small, as well as the broadcast networks, tried to present the news objectivity. What factors, in effect, closed the deal? The relative neutrality of broadcast journalists was explained in large measure by federal regulations that all but mandated fairness. But there are other explanations as to why our national news culture, whether print or broadcast, preferred the middle ground."

New houses were built on top of the ruins of old ones because hauling away rubble was labour intensive and it was much easier to simply spread it out and build straight on top.\n\n\nRivers periodically flooded and added a layer of silt, while in dry regions the wind was constantly blowing in sand and dust.

It found that non-EU immigration was associated with a reduction in the employment of UK-born workers during 1995-2010.\n* No statistically significant effects were found for EU immigration. The MAC analysis also suggests that the likelihood of a negative impact of immigration on employment of UK-born workers is likely to be greatest during economic downturns."

In order to sell, perfume always has to be more than something that smells nice that you spray on yourself.\n\n\n[Image]\n\n\nSo there is opportunity to indulge in fantasy, and a creative director can make them as bizarre as they want, with limitless budget.

Since you would probably prefer that your engine not explode, you have to keep an eye on the redline, especially in a manual-transmission car. When you shift gears in a manual transmission car, you're making sure that the engine stays below the redline. To shift gears, you move the gear shift and hold down the clutch. The shift lever controls rods that control forks that engage the gears. The clutch is what connects the engine to the transmission. The transmission's input shaft has to spin at the same rpm as the engine. In a five-speed transmission, there are five different gear ratios that relate to the input shaft in order to yield a different rpm value for the output shaft.\n\n\nDespite the redline guideline, there is still only a narrow rpm range in which your engine works its best in terms of torque and horsepower. Shifting gears allows you to stay close to your engine's maximum performance range when possible. The problem with this narrow performance range is that it only works at a single gear ratio, which means your car only performs its best at one specific speed.\n\n\nContinuously variable transmissions,"

The only way to get all the mass as close to planet's center of gravity as possible is to form a sphere. The technical name for this process is \"isostatic adjustment.\""

Since planets spin, there can be bulges in their round shapes. The faster the planet spins, the bigger the bulges. Meaning faster spinning planets might be a little less spherical than other planets, and they could be a little flattened. Additionally, objects can impact planets, creating craters and bumps on their surfaces.\n\n\nFor comparison, you can look at asteroids. Smaller asteroids are generally not round. In fact, they are jagged, fragmented, and irregular in shape. This is because small asteroids have very weak gravitational pulls, meaning they cannot pull all the material surrounding them towards their center equally. Therefore, unlike planets, these small asteroids are not spherical and round.\n\n\nP lanets are round because gravity causes all the material to gather equally around a gravitational center, but not all planets are perfectly round. They have imperfections in their shapes and on their surfaces, but they generally keep their round, spherical shape."

Two of the primary types of meristem are the root apical meristem (at the tips of roots) and the shoot apical meristem (at shoot tips)^. Within the shoot apical meristem the plant cells divide and begin to differentiate into different cell types (such as different cells of the leaf, or vascular cells). Later growth (of, say, a leaf) is largely a result of cell expansion (although cell division does still occur, but drops off as the leaf expands). Therefore, if you punch a hole in a leaf, it probably won't be filled in because the cells in that leaf have finished growing and dividing."

The meristems in the axillary buds can grow to form branches. Different plants obviously make different numbers of branches, but there is a common control mechanism known as apical dominance, where the meristem at the tip of the shoot suppresses the growth of the lower axillary buds. This is why a shoot with no branches can be made to grow branches by cutting off the tip (gardeners often do this to make \"leggy\" plants more bushy).\n\n\nAll of that was a long explanation to say, no, a plant doesn't normally^^ regenerate in the sense of filling in cells that have gone missing. However, if you cut off a shoot, the next remaining bud might begin to grow and, in a sense, replace the part that was lost. In that case, an existing bud is recruited to form a new branch and replace lost functionality, but I wouldn't say that qualifies as regenerating missing tissue."

A speed wobble typically starts when the front wheel elevates from the ground when you accelerate, do a wheelie, or run into a pothole.\n\n\nIf the front wheels of your bike settle back on the road at an angle, the wheel is supposed to get back into a straight line. However, sometimes the effort of aligning the forks is so great that your bike will overextend the straight line and land on the opposite side.

Whenever you add weight to either section of your bike, this affects its wiggle rate.\n\n\nRapid acceleration, hitting potholes, or doing a wheelie all have the potential to displace the weight of your bike. After the wobble starts, the external forces increase and can worsen to the point where the ride loses control. Of course, when this happens, the potential to crash is highly likely. Other common causes of motorcycle wobbles include:\n\n\n\u25cf Speed \u2014 With specific makes and models, the bike may not be able to operate once it hits a certain rate. However, any motorcycle, especially when you corner, puts increased strain on the parts and could lead to wobbling.\n\n\n\u25cf Wheel bearings \u2014 If the bearings get worn out, this could cause lateral axle movement which leads to wobbling. New wheel bearings could run you anywhere from $10 to upwards of $60.\n\n\n\u25cf Swingarm \u2014 When the swingarm moves too much, particularly in the case of sportbike suspensions,"

The system uses water or molten salt as a medium for energy storage. The basic principle behind it is the conversion of the energy from solar radiation to heat stored in the medium. Some of the newest solar thermal plants are able to store from 8 to 15 hours of energy [7].\n\n\nOther possibility is the use of large batteries that get charged by the sun and provide energy when there is a lack of sunshine. Tesla is probably the best known in connection with some large-scale projects, such as the installation of a battery farm in Hawaii, which should be able to store 24 hours supply of energy [8]."

Penmanship is shaped by a person's life experiences, their character and how they were taught to write, according to Richard Fraser, a handwriting analysis expert and forensic handwriting examiner in Westwood, Mass.\n\n\n\"If a person experiences a traumatic event, their handwriting may change,\" Fraser said. \"Handwriting reflects a person's personality and state of mind an organized person will most likely take care to make sure that every letter is neatly written.\""

Handwriting is influenced by a person's anatomy, for example, bone structure affects how one holds a pen. Hand-eye coordination, muscle memory and mental ability in copying proper penmanship also influence writing, according to Fraser. Handwriting can change over time as these physical and mental characteristics change.\n\n\nBut genetic influence only goes so far. People whose handwriting is extremely similar to their parents didn't inherit it they simply copied it, maybe even subconsciously."

Enzymes readily metabolize sucrose, releasing energy and, if our diet contains excess calories, causing fat deposition.\n\n\nSaccharin, once the most popular artificial sweetener, binds to T1r3 much more strongly than does sucrose, owing to the differing structures of the two molecules. Therefore, we sense saccharin as being approximately 300 times as sweet as the same amount of sucrose. Moreover, saccharin passes through the body without being metabolized and thus has no caloric content.\n\n\nAspartame (NutraSweet^TM), currently the most-used artificial sweetener, also binds to T1r3 more strongly than sucrose does and tastes nearly 200 times as sweet. Unlike saccharin, however, aspartame is metabolized, yielding methanol and the amino acids phenylalanine and aspartic acid. Further metabolism of these products does yield calories, but far fewer than those obtained from the amount of sucrose required to produce the same sweetening effect."

A 6 core 3.0GHz processor has 6 processing units each with a clock speed of 3.0GHz. The 6 core processor we just described has a total clock speed of 18.0GHz.

This process also seems to have made it easier for the outer planets to form moons.\n\n\nSo, the combination of large gravitational forces, the existence of volatile materials such as ices and the shepherding of material by numerous moons probably mean the outer planets were far more likely to form and keep planetary rings."

                "text": "Universal remotes require arcane setup codes, and none of them control all the functions of every device. A few manufacturers have used one-way radio frequency control, which avoids the aim problem but also prevents the use of universal remotes.\n\n\nThe mobile device industry, by contrast, has successfully herded all the cats so Bluetooth actually works, at least for common functions. You can generally pair any headset with any phone. As a sysadmin I carry a Bluetooth keyboard for my phone, and that will also pair with just about anything that needs a keyboard.\n\n\nSo why not use Bluetooth for AV remote controls? It has more than enough range, the transceivers are cheap and low power, and there is already a mechanism to negotiate which functions each device can perform. This would allow for two-way remote controls. A universal remote would pair with all your devices, like a headset pairs with your mobile phone, and would map all the buttons automatically."

                "text": "The requirements for wireless connectivity on Xbox makes Bluetooth simply unsuitable in several ways. First and foremost is bandwidth. Speaking to Xbox Senior Hardware Program Manager Gabi Mitchel at a previous event, she described how the Xbox One wireless signal can support up to eight controllers and headsets while maintaining sub 8ms latency. Bluetooth, conversely, can manage around two.\n\n\nAdditionally, Bluetooth is highly susceptible to interference from other devices, due to the way it continually scans for new connections. If you're someone who wears a Bluetooth-enabled watch or uses a Bluetooth-enabled phone, simply being in range of your Xbox would impact the bitrate, and thus responsiveness, of your controls.\n\n\nIf Microsoft leveraged Bluetooth, they would also be forced to conform to specific standards set by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group, which Microsoft can't directly control. The Xbox Wireless signal gives Microsoft far more flexibility, which is why we can now get laptops and headsets with Xbox Wireless baked directly within."

They believed in more wholesome living and doing what they could with what Earth has to offer.\n\n\nMuch of the hippie movement came about as a result of the Vietnam War. The people of the U.S. were constantly paranoid and developed a sort of greed that came along with the anger of this war. Tensions among Americans built, and these white, middle-class youngsters lead the way to change it. The hippie movement was all about finding oneself and rejecting the need to conform to what society expects of us all. It was also about fighting peacefully against war and violence. Hippies believed that the government was the root of all the country\u2019s problems as well as greed and hatred that ran rampant in the streets. The goal was to get the country to see that war is not the answer to its problems, but rather peace, love, and freedom"

Mechanical processes, such as roasting, chopping and grinding play a role because they disrupt the cell wall of almonds and affect particle size. Particle size is also affected when almonds are chewed and digested in the body. The larger the particle size, the less the almond is broken down by digestive enzymes and the more of the almond is excreted, so fewer calories are absorbed. The reverse is also true: the smaller the particle size, the more calories are absorbed. Further research is needed to better understand the results of this study and how this method of measuring calories could potentially affect the calorie count of other foods."

The idea is to invest in a company\u2019s balance sheet and infrastructure until it reaches a sufficient size and credibility so that it can be sold to a corporation or so that the institutional public-equity markets can step in and provide liquidity. In essence, the venture capitalist buys a stake in an entrepreneur\u2019s idea, nurtures it for a short period of time, and then exits with the help of an investment banker."

A liquidation feature simulates debt by giving 100% preference over common shares held by management until the VC\u2019s $3 million is returned. In other words, should the venture fail, they are given first claim to all the company\u2019s assets and technology.

In fact, if you prevent rabbits from doing this, they will develop health problems, and young ones will fail to thrive. Fortunately, dogs do not need to get nutrition this way. It is, however, a normal, natural behavior at some canine life stages. Mother dogs will lick their puppies to urge them to eliminate, and clean up their feces by eating it, for about the first three weeks after birth. Puppies will also naturally engage in this behavior, eating both their own poop (autocoprophagia), poop from other dogs (allocoprophagia), as well as poop from cats and other animals. Some dogs find horse manure and goose droppings particularly appealing. Eating their own poop is harmless, but consuming poop from other animals may cause health problems if the stool is contaminated with parasites, viruses, or toxins. In most cases, this behavior will fade before the puppy is about nine months old."

This compound occurs in varying degrees depending on the amount of charring and the length of time they were exposed to the high temperature.\n\n\nIn 2007, a study done in the Netherlands indicated the risk of cancer increased when test subjects ingested acrylamide, especially in women. Other studies with rodents have shown that exposure to acrylamide increases the chance of developing several different types of cancer. Two research organizations, the National Toxicology Program and the International Agency for Research on Cancer both have named acrylamide a \u201cprobable human carcinogen\u201d.

This is because longboards are designed for easy and smooth riding, and provide the proper amount of stability by being wider and longer than a standard skateboard.\n\n\nAdditionally, longboards typically have thicker wheels, to prevent you from tripping over your board. It\u2019s important to note, though, that longboards tend to be on the heavier side, and younger skaters might have trouble controlling them as a result."

Until the 1800s, barbers served as unsophisticated dentists, pulling teeth and piercing abscesses after giving you a nice, close shave. As time went on, dentistry (and ophthalmology, to some degree) was regarded as less advanced than medicine, which seeped into the minds of Congress while they formulated public health insurance policies in the 1960s. As just one example of the general sentiment during those times, in 1940, an appellate court in New York decided that dentists weren\u2019t doctors, and thus not deserving of the same prestige."

Higher-order terms (such as the magnetic quadrupole moment) may be needed in addition to the dipole moment for extended objects.\n\n\nThe magnetic dipole moment of an object is readily defined in terms of the torque that the object experiences in a given magnetic field. The same applied magnetic field creates larger torques on objects with larger magnetic moments. The strength (and direction) of this torque depends not only on the magnitude of the magnetic moment but also on its orientation relative to the direction of the magnetic field. The magnetic moment may be considered, therefore, to be a vector. The direction of the magnetic moment points from the south to north pole of the magnet (inside the magnet).\n\n\nThe magnetic field of a magnetic dipole is proportional to its magnetic dipole moment.

In a third-class lever system, the effort is the middle component and lies between the fulcrum and load.\n\n\nThere are many examples of third class lever systems, including both flexion and extension at the knee joint. These movements are involved in running, jumping and kicking. During flexion at the knee, the point of insertion of the hamstrings on the tibia is the effort, the knee joint is the fulcrum and the weight of the leg is the load. Third class lever systems are used to increase the speed of a body and allow a wide range of movement."

The third class levers in the body serve to increase the distance moved by the load compared to the distance that the muscle contracts.\n\n\nThe tradeoff for this increase in distance is that the force required to move the load must be greater than the mass of the load. For example, the biceps brachia of the arm pulls on the radius of the forearm, causing flexion at the elbow joint in a third class lever system. A very slight change in the length of the biceps causes a much larger movement of the forearm and hand, but the force applied by the biceps must be higher than the load moved by the muscle."

As an example of this variation within the same digital image size, the filesize range of JPEGs shot with my current camera (stored at about 96% / Adobe 11 quality), at 18 Mp, varies from 4 Mb to 11 Mb - the variation a result of colour and brightness in each photo.

To function properly, engines need both fuel and air. The combustion of fuel and air within the combustion chambers of a vehicle's cylinders allows the engine to produce power. Without air, an engine will be missing a key component of its performance.\n\nWorse Fuel Economy\n\nA dirty air filter can drastically reduce the fuel efficiency of a vehicle's engine. Modern vehicles can adapt to various situations and conditions quickly. However, this can come with a cost. When poor airflow is detected by the computer of a vehicle's engine, the computer will allow the engine to compensate for the decreased airflow by increasing the amount of fuel that is used in the air-fuel mixture. This allows the vehicle to produce enough performance to propel the vehicle forward. Over time, as a result, a driver will continually need to take more trips to gas stations for fuel due to the decreased fuel efficiency of their vehicle's engine"

If so, you know that despite having no added flavoring, water can taste different from place to place.\n\n\nWhen water is served with ice, the cold water lowers the sensitivity of our taste buds which makes us less likely to notice slight differences in flavor.\n\n\nWhen we drink a cold glass of water, the ice also helps to balance out any impurities in the water, giving us a clean and fresh-tasting drink.\n\n\nThis is the same reason that many other beverages taste best when served with ice. A cold drink presents a more balanced set of flavors that our taste buds love."

Researchers from the University of California San Francisco theorize the neurons in the brain that monitor blood composition can trigger the feeling of thirst whenever the body\u2019s water levels are imbalanced. It is believed that as soon as you start drinking cold liquids, the signals from the neurons subside and they completely turn off once you consume enough liquid."

Sleepwalkers have their eyes open: They can see their environment but not consciously. While sleepwalkers are in a state of deep sleep, the part of the brain in charge of motion is awake. Only the part of the brain that correlates with awareness and cognition remains asleep. Sleepwalkers are essentially awake and asleep at the same time. As the cortex, which is the part of the brain that controls thinking and voluntary movement, is asleep during slow-wave sleep, the movements sleepwalkers make are controlled by other parts of the brain and are more or less reflexive."

Sleepwalking and other sleep disorders appear to be on the rise in our demanding and fast-paced society, in which getting a good night\u2019s sleep seems to be increasingly dif\ufb01cult. Many people resort to prescription (or nonprescription) drugs to induce sleep, but sometimes this only compounds the problem. Sleep deprivation, especially in combination with drugs and alcohol, is known to induce sleepwalking in some people, and behavior while sleepwalking is extremely unpredictable, particularly in a new environment. Any adult with a tendency to sleepwalk has the potential to experience an accident and can be at risk of real injury. But, until recently, published reports of injuries as a result of sleepwalking were rare, and somnambulism and other sleep disorders are frequently overlooked in the medical school curriculum."

Bending any material increases its strength and rigidity. This is because; rolling the paper increases its moment of inertia around the bending axis.\n\n\nsoft drinks are served chilled. When a liquid is cooled, its volume changes and the bottle must not buckle because of this change in volume. The corner or the tip of the bump can slightly expand/contract without breaking which takes care of the change in volume of the liquid.\n\n\n[Image]One more reason is that most of the soft drinks are pressurized by filling gas; the plastic bottle must be able to withstand the pressure. It should also absorb the shocks when you accidently drop down the bottle. Next time you buy a soft drink, try crushing the bottle. You can easily crush the top part but you will find it hard to crush the foot of the bottle. This foot also improves the stability"

One of their methods is to try and avoid turning through oncoming traffic at a junction. Although this might be going in the opposite direction of the final destination, it reduces the chances of an accident and cuts delays caused by waiting for a gap in the traffic, which would also waste fuel.\n\nUPS have designed their vehicle routing software to eliminate as many left-hand turns as possible (in countries with right-hand traffic). Typically, only 10% of the turns are left turns. As a result, the company claims it uses 10 million gallons less fuel, emits 20,000 tonnes (22,000 tons) less carbon dioxide, and delivers 350,000 more packages every year. The efficiency of planning routes with its navigation software this way has even helped the firm cut the number of trucks it uses by 1,100, bringing down the company\u2019s total distance travelled by 28.5 million miles\u2014despite the longer routes."

Growing in height and muscle mass are two basic anabolic processes. At the cellular level, anabolic processes can use small molecules called monomers to build polymers, resulting in often highly complex molecules. For example, amino acids (monomers) can be synthesized into proteins (polymers), much like a builder can use bricks to create a large variety of buildings.\n\n\nCatabolic processes break down complex compounds and molecules to release energy.

Trouble staying asleep: Waking you up during the night.\n3. Altering the stages of sleep: You don't sleep as deeply, and you get proportionately less REM sleep.\n\n\nDifferent people have different tolerances to noise when they're trying to sleep, but on average a sound exposure level above 55 dBA causes a sleeping person to awaken. However, even if a noise doesn't fully wake you up, it can cause other disturbances as you sleep. You have more restless body movements, your heart rate goes up, your blood pressure increases, your breathing changes. These physiological effects are seen with sound exposure levels as low as 40 dBA."

This response occurs in a primitive part of the brain (the amygdala), and triggers stress hormone secretions even when we're asleep. If this happens repeatedly, over time our stress hormone levels can become chronically elevated, a condition which is associated with a wide range of negative health effects."

Whether it is a vestige of surviving in the wilderness or for some other reason, we tend to respond to external stimuli while asleep. In other words, if we hear a noise, we will wake up. This is advantageous if a lion is trying to eat us while we sleep in a cave, but when the neighbor is blasting the radio too loud, it is less desirable.\n\n\nWhen we hear a noise, we may not become fully conscious, but we certainly will come out of the deeper stages of sleep. If we are trying to sleep in a noisy environment, our ability to enjoy restful deep sleep will be compromised. It is, therefore, best to try to keep things as quiet as possible.\n\n\nSome may benefit from using a white noise machine (or a fan), putting in earplugs, or keeping a radio or television on low volume to drown out street noises."

Averageness, symmetry, and sexual dimorphism are good candidates for biologically based standards of beauty. A critical review and meta-analyses indicate that all three are attractive in both male and female faces and across cultures. Theorists have proposed that face preferences may be adaptations for mate choice because attractive traits signal important aspects of mate quality, such as health. Others have argued that they may simply be by-products of the way brains process information. Although often presented as alternatives, I argue that both kinds of selection pressures may have shaped our perceptions of facial beauty."

If the female-specific features of a female composite face are enhanced, the resulting face is perceived as more attractive than the composite.

These traits have been interpreted as signs of high estrogen/testosterone ratio and therefore cues of high fertility. However, these same traits are also a species-specific characteristic of Homo sapiens that differentiates it from other hominid species. Preference for caricature of human features could represent a relic of species recognition mechanisms. Female preferences for male faces proved to be more variable than male preferences for female faces. Different facial traits are preferred in the choice of short-term and long-term partners. Preference for short term depend on the hormonal status and changes across the menstrual cycle and is influenced by contraceptive hormonal treatment. Psychological factors are also important sources of variance: female preferences correlate with self-perceived attractiveness, status in a relationship and degree of gender-conformity."

Lenses with a focal length \u2013 defined as the distance between the center of a lens and the point at which objects are brought into clear focus \u2013 of 1 meter (about 39 inches) have a diopter strength of 1. Since diopter strength is based on the inverse of the focal length, a 2 diopter lens is not 2 meters but 1/2 meter, a 3 diopter lens is 1/3 meter and so forth. This is important because magnification increases as the lens focal length gets shorter, which is why wearing higher diopter strength lenses allows for sharper, clearer images closer to your eyes."

The group reports that, in the U.S., desalinated water costs at least five times as much to harvest as other sources of fresh water. Similar high costs are a big hurdle to desalination efforts in poor countries as well, where limited funds are already stretched too thin.\n\n\nOn the environmental front, widespread desalination could take a heavy toll on ocean biodiversity. \"Ocean water is filled with living creatures, and most of them are lost in the process of desalination,\" says Sylvia Earle, one of the world's foremost marine biologists and a National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence. \u201cMost are microbial, but intake pipes to desalination plants also take up the larvae of a cross-section of life in the sea, as well as some fairly large organisms\u2026part of the hidden cost of doing business,\u201d she says."

Some of these factors were also used by human beings before modern technology provided all sorts of resources and machines to pinpoint where we are and where we're going at all times.\n\n\nOne thing birds definitely rely upon is the Sun. The Sun rises in the east and sets in the west. Birds flying south for the winter can stay on track by using the Sun's position in the sky throughout the day as a guide.\n\n\nOf course, once the Sun sets, it isn't much help as a guide. Luckily, many birds can also navigate by the position of the stars in the sky once night rolls around. Constellations guided many sailors at night before modern technology came along. Birds can use the stars as navigational aids in the same way.\n\n\nBirds also have the benefit of a bird's eye view. Human hikers lost in the woods sometimes must climb to the top of the nearest mountain to be able to see natural or man-made landscape features, like roads or coastlines, to find their way home. Birds just take to the sky where they get an awesome view of everything below them. Sometimes traveling south is as simple as following the path"

Hair development is generally controlled by hormones circulating through the body, which is why puberty and its hormonal tidal wave triggers a flood of hair in new and interesting places. Dawson believes that androgens, hormones like testosterone related to the development of male sex characteristics, floating around our bodies sometimes randomly hit hair precursor stem cells in our skin.\n\n\nWhen this occurs at the right time, and in the right dosage, the combination may trigger the development of a new hair cell in a mostly hairless part of our bodies, or of a hair cell that produces unusual hair for a given hairy part of the body. In men, time and chance\u2014the law of large numbers\u2014likely account for the emergence of more rogue hairs as we age, especially as testosterone levels tend to drop in older men. In women, massive hormonal shifts due to pregnancy, menopause, or other potential life changes can cause a comparative spike in testosterone, coaxing out more rogue hairs.\n\n\nOther hair researchers doubt that androgens activate stem cells, instead suspecting that they hit existing follicles that"

That\u2019s far short of the maximum total penalties the oversight board could have demanded the firms pay\u2014some $1.6 billion, POGO calculates.\n\n\nWhile the Big Four failed to properly audit their clients in 31.1% of cases examined by the PCAOB since 2009, the PCAOB has only disciplined them in 6.6% of those cases, including in actions also taken by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), according to POGO data. (The SEC oversees the PCAOB and sometimes takes on high-profile cases involving auditors.)\n\n\nKPMG hasn\u2019t been fined a single time, POGO reports\u2014despite it boasting the worst failure rate at 36.6%. In 2017 alone,"

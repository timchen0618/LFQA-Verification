            " A runner's heart rate is lower than a non runner's because of the physical changes that occur from regular endurance training.",
            "As the body adapts to the exercise, the vagal tone increases, suppressing the heart rate.",
            "Training also increases the heart's size, so it can push out a larger volume of blood with each contraction.",
            "This means that a lower heart rate can deliver the same blood volume as a higher heart rate in an untrained heart.",
            "In addition, regular exercise conditions the heart to beat more slowly during periods of rest, making it less susceptible to disease.",
            "Exercise also increases the heart muscle mass, so it takes less effort for the heart to pump blood efficiently.",
            "As a result, the runner's heart requires fewer beats per minute to keep the blood circulating.",

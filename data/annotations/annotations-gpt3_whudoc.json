            "The exact answer to why some planets form rings while others form moons is still a matter of scientific dispute, although there are a few theories that explain it.",
            "One theory suggests that the rings are formed from material that is too close to the planet for it to coalesce into a moon due to its gravitational pull, so it spreads out in orbit around the planet as a ring instead.",
            "Another idea is that a close call by a moon or comet results in the planet\u2019s gravitational tidal force breaking up those bodies, the debris of which then becomes a ring system.",
            "The giant planets, such as Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, formed much farther away from the Sun than the terrestrial planets, such as Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.",
            "This larger volume of space and lower gravity of the Sun in the giant-planet region allowed them to form like solar systems in miniature, pulling in lots of material and having a disk of gas, dust, and ice surrounding them during formation.",
            "Any dust or ice not incorporated into the planet itself would have coalesced into the regular moons we see today around the giant planets.",
            "The terrestrial planets, on the other hand, formed much closer to the Sun with much less material around them, and they grew slowly by accreting many small rocky planetesimals and never grew massive enough to capture a disk of gas and dust.",
            "Earth\u2019s Moon probably formed through a direct collision, as any large object striking a planet would have thrown material off the world into orbit, allowing it to coalesce into a moon."
